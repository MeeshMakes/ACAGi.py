# Changelog
## [0.1.38] - 2025-10-18
### Added
- Introduced a Windows elevation helper that relaunches ACAGi with the
  ``runas`` verb when administrative privileges are missing, guarding against
  infinite recursion with the ``ACAGI_ELEVATED`` environment flag and logging
  bootstrap decisions for operators.

### Validation
- `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`

## [0.1.37] - 2025-10-18
### Fixed
- Reused ACAGi's guarded DPI helper inside `Codex_Terminal.py` so both
  entrypoints share the same idempotent Qt bootstrap and avoid import-time
  configuration.
- Moved the helper invocation to the QApplication construction path to prevent
  late calls after Qt has already been initialised by an embedding host.
- Marked the logic inbox task for factoring the Qt bootstrap helper as
  completed now that the entrypoints share the guard.

### Validation
- `python -m compileall Codex_Terminal.py`
- `python -m compileall ACAGi.py/Codex_Terminal.py`

## [0.1.36] - 2025-10-18
### Fixed
- Removed the module-level DPI policy invocation and now invoke the guard only
  immediately before `QApplication` creation so embedded hosts can opt out while
  standalone launches still configure Qt as early as possible.
- Ensured the high-DPI helper records `_HIGH_DPI_POLICY_APPLIED` for skip
  branches and after execution, preventing redundant retries when multiple
  entrypoints attempt to configure Qt within the same process.
- Added an early-return path in `main()` when a `QApplication` already exists
  so ACAGi avoids constructing duplicate application instances.

### Validation
- `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`

## [0.1.35] - 2025-10-17
### Fixed
- Hardened the high-DPI rounding helper to bail out when a Qt core application
  already exists, preventing Qt's fatal "must be called before creating the
  QGuiApplication" shutdown during ACAGi startup.

### Validation
- `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`

## [0.1.34] - 2025-10-17
### Fixed
- Updated the ACAGi main window to embed the chat view inside the draggable
  Terminal Desktop canvas when running standalone so startup mirrors the
  Codex Terminal experience instead of displaying a bare chat pane.

### Validation
- `python -m py_compile ACAGi.py`

## [0.1.33] - 2025-10-17
### Fixed
- Added a boot-time PySide6 availability guard that logs installation guidance
  instead of throwing `ModuleNotFoundError`, allowing headless workflows to
  continue running automation helpers.

### Validation
- `python ACAGi.py` *(logs missing PySide6 guidance; exits with code 1)*
- `python -m py_compile ACAGi.py`

## [0.1.32] - 2025-10-16
### Fixed
- Hardened the high-DPI rounding policy guard so embedded Qt hosts log and skip
  the setter instead of crashing when a `QGuiApplication` already exists.

### Validation
- `python -m py_compile ACAGi.py`

## [0.1.31] - 2025-10-15
### Fixed
- Deferred the `flush_pending_sentinel_events()` invocation until after its
  definition so sentinel history replay no longer raises a module-import
  `NameError`.

### Validation
- `python ACAGi.py` *(fails: missing `PySide6`; import still exercises sentinel
  flush without raising `NameError`)*
- `python -m py_compile ACAGi.py`

## [0.1.30] - 2025-10-15
### Fixed
- Relocated the `EVENT_DISPATCHER` singleton above the remote access guard so
  module import no longer risks a `NameError` before the dispatcher exists.
- Repositioned the remote access helpers to follow the dispatcher utilities,
  keeping inline documentation accurate about boot ordering expectations.

### Validation
- `python ACAGi.py` *(fails: missing `PySide6` in container; dispatcher ordering validated up to import stage)*

## [0.1.29] - 2025-10-14
### Fixed
- Reordered `RemoteAccessController` initialisation to occur after the event
  dispatcher is created so ACAGi boots without raising `NameError` and the
  Codex Terminal / Virtual Desktop wiring stays intact.
- Logged session context in `logs/session_2025-10-14.md` to document the
  remediation path and uphold archival policy.

### Validation
- `python -m py_compile ACAGi.py`

## [0.1.28] - 2025-10-13
### Changed
- Hoisted `APP_NAME`, `VD_LOGGER_NAME`, and log sink constants to the top of
  `ACAGi.py` so `SafetyManager` and other boot-time subsystems can initialise
  loggers without encountering `NameError` exceptions during module import.
- Recorded the associated session plan in `logs/session_2025-10-13.md` for
  traceability per governance requirements.

### Validation
- `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`

## [0.1.27] - 2025-10-12
### Added
- Introduced a status bar **Self-Implementation Mode** toggle that wires a new
  autonomy controller into the Rationalizer, task bucket pipeline, and sentinel
  event streams.
- Added telemetry publishing on `autonomy.self_impl` and appended session notes
  for every autonomous cycle so operators can audit generated tasks.

### Changed
- Updated `policies.json` with a dedicated `self_impl` operation enforcing
  serialized execution, 900â€¯s watchdogs, and network denial; sentinel events now
  pause the mode on quota or loop violations.
- Documented the new workflow and manual observation steps in `README.md` and
  refreshed status panel UX to surface the toggle state.
- Emitted explicit `autonomy.self_impl` sub-events when sentinel policies pause
  the controller so observers can correlate cycle history with energy or loop
  enforcement in real time.

### Validation
- `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`
- Manual: enable Self-Implementation Mode, observe `autonomy.self_impl` and
  sentinel events in the Log Observatory, and confirm the status bar pauses when
  energy or loop policies trigger.

## [0.1.26] - 2025-10-12
### Added
- Introduced reusable helpers to load and persist `policies.json`, regenerating
  defaults when missing and writing sorted, indented JSON for review-friendly
  diffs.

### Changed
- Updated coder/test/macro policy defaults with explicit duration caps,
  parallel slot limits, and a shared network command blocklist consumed by the
  safety manager and sentinel monitors.
- Enhanced `SafetyManager` and `run_checked` so operation policies now acquire
  parallel slots, clamp timeouts, strip network proxies, and emit sentinel
  events when bans or timeouts trigger.

### Validation
- Ran `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to confirm syntax integrity.
- Logged planned policy override tests in `logs/session_2025-10-02.md`.

## [0.1.25] - 2025-10-11
### Added
- Automated startup processing of `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`, publishing events or scheduling task buckets for actionable inbox entries while preserving deferred instructions on disk.

### Changed
- Extended the shutdown coordinator to write success/failure/anchor summaries into both durable session notes and the dated session log, capturing logic inbox dispatch outcomes for follow-up reviews.

### Validation
- Ran `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to confirm syntax integrity.
- Manual verification: review `vd_system.log` for the "Logic inbox startup processing" summary and confirm `logs/session_<date>.md` receives the shutdown section with anchors.

## [0.1.24] - 2025-10-10
### Added
- Emitted structured `system.sentinel` events for Codex bridge loss, sandbox
  corruption repairs, and repeated task regressions with UI dialogs that meet
  high-contrast requirements and surface recovery guidance.
- Created `Dev_Logic/Implemented_logic/2025-10-10-sentinel-failure-injection.md`
  documenting manual failure injection steps for each new sentinel pathway.

### Changed
- Extended the sentinel monitor with regression counters that escalate after
  successive rollbacks and wired the terminal to subscribe to sentinel history
  so startup alerts replay into the chat log.

### Validation
- Ran `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to confirm syntax integrity.
- Logged failure simulation procedures in
  `Dev_Logic/Implemented_logic/2025-10-10-sentinel-failure-injection.md`.

## [0.1.23] - 2025-10-10
### Added
- Introduced a coordinated shutdown pipeline that flushes event dispatcher queues,
  syncs log handlers, persists durable memory stores, and appends a structured
  session note via the new `ShutdownCoordinator` helper.
- Captured crash stack traces to timestamped files under the agent `crashes/`
  directory and enhanced the BrainShell crash dialog with report metadata plus a
  high-contrast terminal fallback banner when Qt is unavailable.

### Changed
- Routed the global exception hook through the shutdown coordinator so crash
  handling triggers the same flush/persist workflow used during graceful exits.

### Validation
- Ran `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to confirm syntax integrity.
- Logged manual crash simulation steps in `logs/session_2025-10-02.md`.

## [0.1.22] - 2025-10-09
### Added
- Added local GitHub Desktop and GitHub CLI detection with status badges in the
  status bar telemetry panel and Settings dialog, avoiding any outbound network
  probes.
- Introduced a `RemoteAccessController` that gates remote fan-out behind an
  explicit toggle, syncs safety policy notices, and emits ScriptSpeak
  `TOGGLE_REMOTE` events with rich metadata.

### Changed
- Extended the status bar summary with remote tooling availability indicators
  alongside remote link posture.
- Updated the Settings dialog to surface remote toggle state and detection
  tooltips inside a dedicated "Remote Access" section.

### Validation
- Ran `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to confirm syntax integrity.
- Documented manual remote toggle verification in
  `logs/session_2025-10-02.md`.

## [0.1.21] - 2025-10-09
### Added
- Introduced a ScriptSpeak parser that normalises verbs, arguments, and flags
  into structured payloads and publishes them on a dedicated `script.command`
  event stream with session log journaling.
- Wired macro playbooks and ad-hoc macro events through the parser so queued
  automation steps emit auditable ScriptSpeak instructions.
- Extended the Rationalizer manager to forward ScriptSpeak guidance emitted in
  job results onto the event bus with per-job metadata, enabling automated
  follow-ups to appear in session transcripts.

### Validation
- Ran `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to confirm syntax integrity.

## [0.1.20] - 2025-10-08
### Added
- Implemented coder/test/verifier lifecycle handlers that capture anchored patches
  with rationales, execute configured validations, and publish bucket telemetry
  for UI consumers.

### Changed
- Routed task bucket failures through the Rationalizer loop and persisted the
  latest failure snapshot in durable memory so operators retain actionable
  learnings alongside telemetry events.

## [0.1.19] - 2025-10-08
### Added
- Added task bucket lifecycle data classes and orchestration helpers that drive
  captureâ†’noteâ†’bucketizeâ†’assembleâ†’applyâ†’testâ†’verifyâ†’promote transitions while
  emitting stage telemetry on new event topics.
- Exposed a bucket stage context/result API so handlers can enrich metadata,
  touched files, and notes for downstream observers.

### Changed
- Introduced a serialization manager that leases Apply/Test/Verify stages when
  buckets touch overlapping files, maintaining parallelism for upstream
  assembly work while preventing conflicting writes.

### Validation
- Ran `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to confirm syntax integrity.

## [0.1.18] - 2025-10-07
### Added
- Introduced a Cerebellum scheduler and Rationalizer manager that spin up
  short-lived workers for intent segmentation and reference resolution while
  enforcing Gate quotas.
- Published cortex rationalizer results on new `cortex.intent` and
  `cortex.reference` event topics alongside telemetry on `system.metrics`.

### Changed
- Extended default settings with Cerebellum quota controls and wired the chat
  workflow to queue Rationalizer jobs whenever a user message is recorded.

### Validation
- Ran `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to confirm syntax integrity.

## [0.1.17] - 2025-10-07
### Added
- Embedded local-first ASR and TTS adapters inside `ACAGi.py` with streaming
  partial transcripts on the `speech.partial` bus topic and barge-in support
  that pauses synthesis while the operator speaks.
- Introduced a shared `SpeechOrchestrator` entry point plus a `speech.request`
  event interface so UI or automation layers can enqueue narration safely.
- Connected a new Amygdala salience pipeline that weights diarization and
  speaker-priority metadata, publishing aggregated scores on `system.salience`.

### Changed
- Extended default settings to include a `voice` section with ASR/TTS tunables
  and propagated configuration reloads through the orchestrator.
- Expanded event dispatcher topics for speech activity, TTS telemetry, and
  salience scoring so downstream docks can subscribe without manual wiring.

### Validation
- Ran `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to confirm syntax integrity.
- Performed manual audio checks by capturing microphone input to verify
  partial transcript streaming, triggering TTS narration, and speaking over it
  to confirm barge-in pauses/resumes playback while logs reflected the state.

## [0.1.16] - 2025-10-06
### Added
- Extended the main window status bar with a telemetry panel that surfaces
  remote fan-out toggles, sandbox posture, CPU/RAM meters, attention mix, and
  OCR duty cycle readouts.
- Subscribed the telemetry panel to Gate/Scheduler updates on the Thalamus
  `system.metrics` topic and documented remote pause/resume handling.

### Validation
- Validated syntax with `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` and recorded telemetry
  smoke checks in `logs/session_2025-10-06.md`.

## [0.1.15] - 2025-10-05
### Added
- Added a Ctrl+K command palette overlay that lists policy-reviewed commands and persisted playbook macros while dispatching selections through the event bus.
- Introduced Dev Space playbook management with JSONL-backed promotion flows and manual macro execution note tracking.

## [0.1.14] - 2025-10-05
### Added
- Introduced a Brain Map dock that lazily initialises a graphics scene to render
  Hippocampus nodes and typed edges with energy/salience overlays and Dev Space
  activation callbacks.
- Added energy heatmap, queue depth, and error ray toggles so operators can
  spotlight different operational metrics while reviewing the graph.

### Changed
- Linked the Brain Map dock with the Virtual Desktop focus helper to jump into
  Dev Space diagnostics whenever a node is selected.
- Ensured theme/settings reloads refresh the Brain Map registry reference and
  exposed a View menu toggle alongside other investigative docks.

## [0.1.13] - 2025-10-05
### Added
- Introduced a Log Observatory dock that tails the shared system log, scans
  process/session streams, and surfaces filter/search controls while live
  streaming Thalamus bus events.

### Changed
- Tabified the Log Observatory with the error console and exposed a view menu
  toggle so operators can quickly switch between diagnostics surfaces.

## [0.1.12] - 2025-10-05
### Added
- Introduced a Virtual Desktop dock that lazily initializes consoles, Dev Space
  tabs, and OCR overlays while streaming event bus updates into the UI.

  append corresponding session JSONL notices with dataset anchors for reruns.

### Changed
- Wrapped the Codex bridge LED in a dedicated health state machine that
  synchronizes tooltips, interpreter toggle availability, and ready-banner
  acknowledgements.
- Wired approval prompt responses and ready detections through the new state
  handling so busy/error transitions surface consistent system notices.

## [0.1.10] - 2025-10-04
### Added
- Introduced a sentinel monitor hub that subscribes to task/status topics, detects loops/regressions/stalls, and publishes immune responses with rationale on the `system.immune` stream.
- Added a versioned `policies.json` template and settings loader support that materializes coder/test allowlists, denylists, sandbox requirements, and approval rules for SafetyManager.

### Changed
- Extended SafetyManager and command helpers to enforce operation policies, surface sandbox mismatches, and expose manual immune response triggering utilities.

## [0.1.9] - 2025-10-02
### Added
- Added a Hippocampus-backed dataset manager dock that lets operators ingest
  tagged files or directories from the UI while kicking off OCR, embedding, and
  summarisation workflows.
