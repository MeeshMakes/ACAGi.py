# Session Log â€” 2025-10-13

## Objective
Restore ACAGi.py to the full Codex-Terminal feature set while preserving the governance-driven refactors (single-file integration, optional dependency policy, logging, and sentinel hooks) introduced in prior sessions.

## Context Snapshot
- Branch: work (no upstream remotes detected; `git fetch` unavailable).
- Reviewed manuals: `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`, latest log `session_2025-10-12.md`.
- Additional assets: baseline script `Codex_Terminal.py`, Dev_Logic reference notes, archived conversations for historical behavior.

## Notable References
- `Codex_Terminal.py`: canonical Agent Virtual Desktop implementation prior to refactor.
- `ACAGi.py`: current monolithic integration that must be reconciled with Codex-Terminal capabilities.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`: documentation requiring updates when functionality changes.
- `policies.json`, `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`: ensure safety integrations remain intact after merge.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Draft an internal merge plan highlighting subsystems to re-import (virtual desktop UI, task orchestration, bridge management, dataset persistence, OCR, safety, repo helper) and identify conflicting refactors inside `ACAGi.py`.
2. Reconcile optional dependency loading and governance utilities so Codex-Terminal widgets coexist with the consolidated ACAGi boot flow (Dev Logic paths, SafetyManager, logging, sentinel monitors).
3. Port remaining modules from `Codex_Terminal.py` into `ACAGi.py`, ensuring docstrings and inline commentary clarify rationale, edge cases, and failure handling.
4. Validate by compiling (`python -m compileall ACAGi.py`) and documenting manual verification steps; update CHANGELOG and README to note the restored Codex-Terminal parity.
5. Capture any new durable lessons in `memory/codex_memory.json` and update logic inbox if follow-up actions emerge.

## Validation Plan
- `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`
- Manual verification: Launch ACAGi GUI, confirm virtual desktop canvas, chat, dataset dock, and bridge controls mirror Codex-Terminal behavior; monitor sentinel log for errors.
