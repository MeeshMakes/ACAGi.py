# Session Log — 2025-10-13

## Objective
- Address NameError risk in SafetyManager initialization by ensuring logging constants are defined before use and validate module compilation.

## Context Snapshot
- git status: clean working tree on branch `work`.
- git log (last 10): captured for reference.
- git diff origin/main...HEAD: failed because `origin/main` is unavailable in this offline workspace.
- git fetch --all --prune: executed (no remotes configured).
- git rebase origin/main: failed (`origin/main` missing).

## Files of Interest
- `ACAGi.py` — SafetyManager logging constants ordering.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Inspect `ACAGi.py` to locate logging constants and the `SafetyManager` constructor usage.
2. Decide between moving constant definitions or injecting logger name parameter; ensure constructor references resolved.
3. Update global `safety_manager` initialization to reference the refactored constant or explicit parameter.
4. Run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to confirm module imports cleanly.
5. Prepare commit and PR summary once tests pass.

## Outstanding Questions
- None identified.

## Follow-up Opportunities
- Consider adding unit tests around SafetyManager logging initialization in future work.
