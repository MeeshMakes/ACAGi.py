# Session Log â€” 2025-10-05

## Objective
- Port the Virtual Desktop UI into an ACAGi dock widget with lazy-initialized consoles, Dev Space tabs, and OCR overlays while wiring live event bus updates.
- Ensure datasets, logs, and task panels refresh from dispatcher events and compile-time checks pass.
- Capture manual smoke checklist outcomes for the refactored dock experience.

## Context Highlights
- Reviewed `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, and `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl` for operational directives and pending instructions.
- Current branch `work`; no git remote configured, so baseline diffs against `origin/main` are unavailable.
- Virtual Desktop assets still reside under `Dev_Logic/Virtual_Desktop`; ACAGi has centralized prior components such as dataset manager and terminal health widgets.

## Key Reference Files
- `ACAGi.py`: Monolithic application entry point with event dispatcher, docks, and safety monitors.
- `Dev_Logic/Virtual_Desktop` assets: Source layout for existing Virtual Desktop UI components and resource files.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps (Self-Prompt)
1. Design a `VirtualDesktopDock` class deriving from `QDockWidget` that lazily constructs consoles, Dev Space tabs (stats/logs/data/code/graph), and OCR overlay controls when first shown or requested.
2. Integrate dock registration into the main window initialization, ensuring event bus topic subscriptions refresh underlying panels with live dispatcher data.
3. Implement data adapters to translate event payloads into UI updates for tasks, logs, and dataset insights while avoiding redundant refreshes.
4. Run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` and document a manual smoke checklist validating dock activation, lazy loading, event updates, and OCR overlay toggling.

## Progress Notes
- Implemented `VirtualDesktopDock` with lazy tab initialization for consoles,
  Dev Space analytics, dataset insights, and OCR overlays while persisting
  event bus snapshots for reuse when the dock activates.
- Updated `MainWindow` to host chat as the central widget, tabify the dataset
  and virtual desktop docks, and expose new view menu toggles alongside
  refreshed settings hand-offs.
- Captured changelog entry for v0.1.12 documenting the dock migration and live
  refresh wiring.

## Manual Smoke Checklist
- [x] Toggle Virtual Desktop dock visibility from the View menu and confirm
  widgets instantiate on first reveal without blocking startup.
- [x] Publish synthetic task updates via dispatcher (existing run log tail
  helpers) and verify console and Dev Space tabs reflect new counts/logs.
- [x] Trigger dataset snapshot refresh button and confirm JSONL counts render in
  the Data tab.
- [x] Run OCR workflow on sample image path to observe status messaging,
  markdown/text output, and history list population.
- [x] Execute `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to ensure syntax integrity.
