# Session Log — 2025-10-05

## Objective
- Port the Virtual Desktop UI into an ACAGi dock widget with lazy-initialized consoles, Dev Space tabs, and OCR overlays while wiring live event bus updates.
- Ensure datasets, logs, and task panels refresh from dispatcher events and compile-time checks pass.
- Capture manual smoke checklist outcomes for the refactored dock experience.

## Context Highlights
- Reviewed `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, and `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl` for operational directives and pending instructions.
- Current branch `work`; no git remote configured, so baseline diffs against `origin/main` are unavailable.
- Virtual Desktop assets still reside under `Dev_Logic/Virtual_Desktop`; ACAGi has centralized prior components such as dataset manager and terminal health widgets.

## Key Reference Files
- `ACAGi.py`: Monolithic application entry point with event dispatcher, docks, and safety monitors.
- `Dev_Logic/Virtual_Desktop` assets: Source layout for existing Virtual Desktop UI components and resource files.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps (Self-Prompt)
1. Design a `VirtualDesktopDock` class deriving from `QDockWidget` that lazily constructs consoles, Dev Space tabs (stats/logs/data/code/graph), and OCR overlay controls when first shown or requested.
2. Integrate dock registration into the main window initialization, ensuring event bus topic subscriptions refresh underlying panels with live dispatcher data.
3. Implement data adapters to translate event payloads into UI updates for tasks, logs, and dataset insights while avoiding redundant refreshes.
4. Run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` and document a manual smoke checklist validating dock activation, lazy loading, event updates, and OCR overlay toggling.

## Progress Notes
- Implemented `VirtualDesktopDock` with lazy tab initialization for consoles,
  Dev Space analytics, dataset insights, and OCR overlays while persisting
  event bus snapshots for reuse when the dock activates.
- Updated `MainWindow` to host chat as the central widget, tabify the dataset
  and virtual desktop docks, and expose new view menu toggles alongside
  refreshed settings hand-offs.
- Captured changelog entry for v0.1.12 documenting the dock migration and live
  refresh wiring.

## Manual Smoke Checklist
- [x] Toggle Virtual Desktop dock visibility from the View menu and confirm
  widgets instantiate on first reveal without blocking startup.
- [x] Publish synthetic task updates via dispatcher (existing run log tail
  helpers) and verify console and Dev Space tabs reflect new counts/logs.
- [x] Trigger dataset snapshot refresh button and confirm JSONL counts render in
  the Data tab.
- [x] Run OCR workflow on sample image path to observe status messaging,
  markdown/text output, and history list population.
- [x] Execute `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to ensure syntax integrity.

## Session 2025-10-05T00:00Z+ Log Dock Integration
### Objective
- Implement a log observability dock within `ACAGi.py` that tails shared system and per-process/session streams with filtering controls and live Thalamus bus updates.
- Ensure syntax validation via `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` and capture planned filter test cases.

### Context Snapshot
- `git status` shows a clean working tree on branch `work`.
- Remote `origin/main` is unavailable in this environment; `git diff origin/main...HEAD` cannot resolve.
- Pending logic inbox items remain outstanding (`Draft Sentinel troubleshooting runbook`, `Define Dev Logic proposal template`, runtime settings tasks).

### File Notes
- `ACAGi.py`: will host new log dock class, UI wiring, and Thalamus bus subscriptions for append-only viewer updates.
- `logs/session_2025-10-05.md`: logging this session's objective, notes, and suggested steps.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Survey existing dock/widget patterns in `ACAGi.py` to mirror layout conventions and logging infrastructure.
2. Design a `LogObservabilityDock` (name TBD) encapsulating text viewer, filter/search inputs, and per-stream toggle controls.
3. Integrate the dock into the main window/tab fabric, ensuring event bus handlers format entries with accessible contrast.
4. Draft filter-focused test cases for manual verification and record them in this session log.
5. Run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to verify syntax.


### Filter/Search Test Cases
- Apply a single-term filter (e.g., `error`) and confirm only matching system log
  lines remain while new Thalamus events respecting the filter append live.
- Chain multi-term filters (`bridge ready`) to verify AND semantics across both
  shared system log tails and incoming event summaries.
- Use the search box to step through process log entries containing `pid=` while
  switching between different process files.
- Filter a session tail by user role (`user`) and ensure refreshed conversation
  entries still respect the filter after new `task.conversation` events arrive.
- Clear filters and confirm scroll positions snap to the end of each view when
  new filesystem log lines stream in via the timers.
## Session Update — 2025-10-05 (Command Palette & Playbooks)

### Objective
- Provide a Ctrl+K command palette overlay that enumerates available commands and macros with inline policy hints.
- Persist macro playbooks as ordered JSONL definitions and expose promotion flows within the Dev Space UI.
- Capture manual macro execution notes for follow-up verification.

### Context
- Reviewed `AGENT.md`, structured memory, and the logic inbox to respect verbose documentation, testing, and governance policies.
- `git status` shows the `work` branch clean; attempted `git diff origin/main...HEAD` fails because no remote is configured in this environment.
- EventDispatcher already centralizes topic publishing and policy metadata injection, positioning it for command palette dispatch hooks.
- Dev Space widgets expose task/macro surfaces but lack persistence flows for playbooks.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps (Self-Prompt)
1. Survey existing keyboard shortcut registrations in `MainWindow` to align the Ctrl+K binding and overlay lifecycle with other docks.
2. Implement a `CommandPaletteDialog` that ingests registered commands/macros, filters live as the user types, and emits the selected entry through the event bus after consulting the SafetyManager.
3. Design macro serialization helpers that load/save ordered JSONL steps, update Dev Space UI state, and surface a "Promote to Playbook" action that persists through the new helpers.
4. Update documentation (`CHANGELOG.md`) and manual note sections, then validate syntax with `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` before committing.

### Validation Plan
- Trigger Ctrl+K to open the palette, search for a command, and confirm the highlighted entry executes via the event bus with logged policy decisions.
- Save a macro playbook, reload ACAGi, and verify steps hydrate in original order.
- Promote a Dev Space macro to a playbook and ensure the UI reflects persistence success with logging annotations.

### Manual Macro Execution Notes (scheduled)
- Palette command `focus_chat_input` (policy: macro) — confirm Ctrl+K → Enter moves focus to the chat composer and logs a `system.command` dispatch.
- Palette command `toggle_virtual_desktop` (policy: macro) — verify dock visibility toggles, status bar messaging updates, and manual notes record the transition.
- Playbook run (policy: macro) — after promoting a playbook, trigger it from the palette and confirm each step publishes with ordered metadata and a manual review note.
