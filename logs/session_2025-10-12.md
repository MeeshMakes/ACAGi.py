# Session Log â€” 2025-10-12

## Objective
Implement a Self-Implementation Mode toggle that empowers ACAGi to autonomously iterate via Rationalizer workflows while keeping Sentinel quota and loop protections active, along with documentation and validation updates.

## Context Snapshot
- Branch: work (no remotes configured; `git fetch`/`origin/main` sync unavailable).
- Reviewed manuals: `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`, latest session log.
- Key constraints: must add verbose inline commentary, update durable documentation (CHANGELOG, README), refresh memory lessons as needed, and record manual verification guidance.

## Notable References
- `ACAGi.py`: MainWindow setup (~L20940+), StatusBarTelemetryPanel (~L20560+), RationalizerManager (~L5826+), Task bucket orchestration (~L14800+), Sentinel safety controls (~L17000+).
- `CHANGELOG.md`: document behavioral deltas.
- `README.md`: home for operator guidance.
- `memory/codex_memory.json`: repository-wide durable lessons repository.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Draft an internal development prompt clarifying expected UI placement, Rationalizer automation hooks, Sentinel policy enforcement, and validation strategy; capture acceptance criteria for logging, quotas, and loop detection.
2. Extend `StatusBarTelemetryPanel` (or adjacent UI control layer) with a Self-Implementation Mode button, wiring it through MainWindow to an autonomy coordinator that orchestrates Rationalizer surveys, task bucket spawning, and learning persistence.
3. Introduce the autonomy coordinator implementation: leverage Rationalizer manager APIs to run continuous surveys, interact with dataset/memory services, and publish results back through existing storage routines. Ensure Sentinel integration clamps energy quotas and halts automation when policy violations or loop patterns surface.
4. Update documentation artifacts (README, CHANGELOG, memory lessons) with usage instructions and manual observation steps; mention Sentinel safeguards and operator expectations.
5. Run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`, capture results, and describe manual observation instructions in the session log & PR testing section.

## Validation Plan
- `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`
- Manual observation: Launch ACAGi, toggle Self-Implementation Mode, monitor the Log Observatory for `autonomy.self_impl` events, confirm Sentinel quota/loop alerts appear in the status panel and automation pauses upon breach.
