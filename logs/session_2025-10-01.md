# Session Log — 2025-10-01

## Objective Prompt
Set up foundational governance scaffolding for the ACAGi Codex repository, ensuring verbose documentation, automation workflows, and memory structures are in place for future autonomous operations.

## Context Review
- Repository default branch: `work` (no remote configured).
- Existing artifact: `README.md` describing ACAGi shell vision.
- No prior `AGENT.md` or memory structures present.

## Actions Taken
1. Drafted a comprehensive `AGENT.md` as the canonical operating manual.
2. Established memory, logging, and archival directories with descriptive guides.
3. Authored Codex PR Sentinel workflow, configuration, and tooling stubs.
4. Seeded logic inbox with pending governance tasks.

## File References
- `AGENT.md` — Operating manual v0.1.0.
- `memory/codex_memory.json` — Durable lessons and procedures.
- `.github/workflows/codex-pr-sentinel.yml` — CI automation skeleton.

## Unresolved Questions
- What additional CI checks (lint/test suites) should be integrated once codebase matures?
- How should Sentinel runbook escalate failures to human maintainers?

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Formalize Sentinel troubleshooting runbook per inbox item 2025-10-01-001.
- Draft Dev Logic proposal template and store in `Dev_Logic/`.
- Implement schema validation tests for memory artifacts.
