# Session Log — 2025-10-01

## Objective Prompt
Set up foundational governance scaffolding for the ACAGi Codex repository, ensuring verbose documentation, automation workflows, and memory structures are in place for future autonomous operations.

## Context Review
- Repository default branch: `work` (no remote configured).
- Existing artifact: `README.md` describing ACAGi shell vision.
- No prior `AGENT.md` or memory structures present.

## Actions Taken
1. Drafted a comprehensive `AGENT.md` as the canonical operating manual.
2. Established memory, logging, and archival directories with descriptive guides.
3. Authored Codex PR Sentinel workflow, configuration, and tooling stubs.
4. Seeded logic inbox with pending governance tasks.

## File References
- `AGENT.md` — Operating manual v0.1.0.
- `memory/codex_memory.json` — Durable lessons and procedures.
- `.github/workflows/codex-pr-sentinel.yml` — CI automation skeleton.

## Unresolved Questions
- What additional CI checks (lint/test suites) should be integrated once codebase matures?
- How should Sentinel runbook escalate failures to human maintainers?

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Formalize Sentinel troubleshooting runbook per inbox item 2025-10-01-001.
- Draft Dev Logic proposal template and store in `Dev_Logic/`.
- Implement schema validation tests for memory artifacts.

## Session Update — 2025-10-01 (Runtime optional-dependency refactor)

### Objective and Sub-goals
- Primary objective: Convert the `requests` and `Pillow` imports in `ACAGi.py` into unconditional top-level imports while preserving optional behavior through runtime capability probes.
- Sub-goals:
  - Design helper utilities that encapsulate optional dependency availability checks and surface user-facing warnings at call-time.
  - Ensure existing workflows for network fetches and image manipulation degrade gracefully when dependencies are absent.
  - Run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` alongside any documented lint/test commands to confirm structural integrity after refactor.

### Context Review
- Repository currently tracks branch `work` without a configured `origin` remote; `git fetch --all` is inapplicable at this time.
- `ACAGi.py` presently assigns `requests = None` and `PIL_AVAILABLE = False` inside try/except guards, and several UI warnings rely on these module-level sentinels.
- Pending logic inbox items 2025-10-01-001 and 2025-10-01-002 remain unresolved; this session focuses exclusively on the optional dependency refactor.

### File-Scoped Notes
- `ACAGi.py`: Lines surrounding the optional dependency imports (currently near the module prologue) require refactoring to remove import-time guards and introduce runtime helpers for warning emission.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Draft helper functions (e.g., `has_requests()` / `ensure_requests_available()`) that cache availability checks and raise or warn when invoked without installed dependencies; incorporate verbose docstrings per repository standards.
2. Replace existing import-time fallback variables with calls to the helpers at each usage site, updating warning messages to trigger from the new runtime checks.
3. Execute `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` and review the repository for additional lint/test scripts, running them if present, documenting outcomes for the commit and PR narrative.

### Actions Completed
- Introduced cached optional dependency helpers in `ACAGi.py` and replaced previous sentinel checks for `requests` and Pillow with runtime probes and targeted warnings.
- Updated clipboard and attachment flows to surface Pillow availability issues through UI alerts, and refreshed Ollama client messaging to reuse the new helpers.
- Recorded the refactor in `CHANGELOG.md` and captured the runtime dependency lesson in `memory/codex_memory.json`.

### Validation Notes
- Ran `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to ensure the module compiles after the import refactor.

### Follow-ups
- Monitor future refactors for additional optional dependencies that should share the helper utilities.

## Session Update — 2025-10-01 (Boot & Environment hardening)

### Objective and Sub-goals
- Primary objective: Introduce a Boot & Environment section in `ACAGi.py` that centralizes DPI policy, workspace/transit path resolution, shared logging, and BrainShell-style crash capture.
- Sub-goals:
  - Inline legacy logger and crash dialog helpers so the boot block is self-contained.
  - Maintain compatibility for existing path helper APIs that other subsystems rely on.
  - Refresh the crash UX to match the high-contrast BrainShell description while preserving CLI fallbacks.

### Context Notes
- `git diff origin/main...HEAD` failed because no `origin/main` remote is configured in this workspace; noted here to track the limitation.
- Logic inbox items 2025-10-01-001 and 2025-10-01-002 remain open; this session focuses solely on runtime bootstrapping.

### File-Scoped Notes
- `ACAGi.py`: Added a `BootEnvironment` manager to resolve workspace/transit folders, configure `vd_system.log`, and install the BrainShell crash dialog; updated helper functions and the entrypoint to consume the new bootstrap.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. **Internal Prompt:** After verifying `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`, review downstream components for assumptions about the relocated path helpers and update docs as needed.
2. Audit other modules for references to the deprecated crash popup helper to prevent stale guidance.
3. Extend automated coverage (when available) to exercise `BootEnvironment.refresh()` with workspace overrides.
