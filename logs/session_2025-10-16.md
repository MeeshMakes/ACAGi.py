# Session Log â€” 2025-10-16

## Objective
- Resolve the startup crash triggered by calling `QGuiApplication.setHighDpiScaleFactorRoundingPolicy` after a `QGuiApplication` instance exists when launching `ACAGi.py`.
- Maintain compliance with Codex governance by updating logs, memory, and changelog entries associated with the fix.

## Context Snapshot
- git status: clean working tree on branch `work` (`git status`).
- git log: reviewed recent commits for prior Qt boot order changes (`git log -n 10 --oneline`).
- git diff origin/main...HEAD: cannot execute because the repository has no `origin` remote configured (documented limitation).

## Context Review
- Re-read `AGENT.md` (v0.1.1) to confirm verbose documentation, logging, and governance requirements.
- Inspected `memory/codex_memory.json` for boot environment and logging lessons relevant to Qt initialization ordering.
- Reviewed `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl` and noted no pending items directly tied to DPI configuration changes.
- Skimmed `Archived Conversation/` and `Dev_Logic/` directories to ensure no supplemental runbooks overrule the current startup policy.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Audit `_ensure_high_dpi_rounding_policy()` to understand failure paths when another Qt host already created an application instance.
2. Implement a defensive guard that catches runtime exceptions and logs guidance instead of crashing while still setting the policy when safe.
3. Update unit-less documentation assets (`CHANGELOG.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`) to capture the new boot guideline.
4. Validate formatting and run available checks (or document tooling gaps) before committing the changes.

## Work Log
- Introduced a dedicated boot logger and wrapped `QGuiApplication` DPI policy
  updates in defensive logging so embedded hosts no longer raise
  `RuntimeError`.
- Recorded the guard as a durable lesson in `memory/codex_memory.json` and
  documented the release in `CHANGELOG.md` per governance requirements.

## Validation
- `python -m py_compile ACAGi.py`

## Follow-ups / Risks
- If the policy still cannot be set inside embedded Qt hosts, consider exposing an opt-out flag recorded in the logic inbox.
