# Session Log — 2025-10-17

## Objective
- Update `ACAGi.py` so that launching the script embeds the terminal within its dedicated virtual desktop, mirroring `Codex_Terminal.py` behaviour.

## Context Snapshot
- git status → clean working tree on branch `work`.
- git log (10) reviewed for recent startup fixes.
- `git diff origin/main...HEAD` failed because `origin/main` is unavailable in this workspace; noting as environment limitation.
- Reviewed governance artefacts: `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`.
- Pending logic inbox items remain dispatched; none directly block this task.

## File Notes
- `ACAGi.py`: Needs boot adjustments so the terminal spawns inside ACAGi’s virtual desktop rather than an external console window.
- `Codex_Terminal.py`: Reference implementation for the desired launch flow.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Inspect `Codex_Terminal.py` startup sequence to understand terminal docking.
2. Modify `ACAGi.py` boot logic to instantiate the terminal inside its virtual desktop before showing the main window.
3. Ensure high-DPI and PySide guards remain intact while integrating the terminal view.
4. Run available sanity checks (likely manual launch via `python ACAGi.py` to confirm no crash).
5. Update documentation (`CHANGELOG.md`) and durable memory if startup behaviour changes materially.

## Open Questions
- Does `ACAGi.py` already instantiate a Virtual Desktop dock that can host the terminal? Need to confirm while editing.

## Follow-Up Todos
- Revisit sentinel troubleshooting runbook task once UI stabilises.
