# Session Log — 2025-10-17

## Objective
- Update `ACAGi.py` so that launching the script embeds the terminal within its dedicated virtual desktop, mirroring `Codex_Terminal.py` behaviour.

## Context Snapshot
- git status → clean working tree on branch `work`.
- git log (10) reviewed for recent startup fixes.
- `git diff origin/main...HEAD` failed because `origin/main` is unavailable in this workspace; noting as environment limitation.
- Reviewed governance artefacts: `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`.
- Pending logic inbox items remain dispatched; none directly block this task.

## File Notes
- `ACAGi.py`: Needs boot adjustments so the terminal spawns inside ACAGi’s virtual desktop rather than an external console window.
- `Codex_Terminal.py`: Reference implementation for the desired launch flow.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Inspect `Codex_Terminal.py` startup sequence to understand terminal docking.
2. Modify `ACAGi.py` boot logic to instantiate the terminal inside its virtual desktop before showing the main window.
3. Ensure high-DPI and PySide guards remain intact while integrating the terminal view.
4. Run available sanity checks (likely manual launch via `python ACAGi.py` to confirm no crash).
5. Update documentation (`CHANGELOG.md`) and durable memory if startup behaviour changes materially.

## Open Questions
- Does `ACAGi.py` already instantiate a Virtual Desktop dock that can host the terminal? Need to confirm while editing.

## Follow-Up Todos
- Revisit sentinel troubleshooting runbook task once UI stabilises.

## Objective (Follow-up)
- Resolve the startup crash where Qt reports `setHighDpiScaleFactorRoundingPolicy` must be invoked before the QGuiApplication exists when launching `ACAGi.py`.

## Context Snapshot
- `git status -sb` → clean branch `work`.
- `git log -n 10 --oneline` reviewed for recent startup fixes.
- `git diff origin/main...HEAD --stat` still unavailable because the workspace lacks an `origin` remote; noting as environment limitation.
- Re-read `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, and `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl` for governance and outstanding directives.

## File Notes
- `ACAGi.py`: `_ensure_high_dpi_rounding_policy()` currently executes at import time and again inside `main()`, yet the user crash log indicates Qt bails out before we can guard against existing applications.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Must capture the boot fix per documentation policy once adjustments land.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Inspect the current DPI guard to understand why it still triggers the Qt fatal error.
2. Adjust the guard so that we never call `setHighDpiScaleFactorRoundingPolicy` after a Qt application exists—likely by deferring invocation until just before standalone boot and skipping it for embedded hosts.
3. Verify via `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` (PySide6 absent locally) and document the testing limitation.
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md` summarizing the launch fix and any behavioural changes.
5. Stage, commit with a conventional message, and prepare the PR narrative via `make_pr`.

## Open Questions
- Do embedded consumers still need the DPI policy applied, or is the environment variable fallback sufficient? Pending confirmation after adjusting the guard.

## Follow-Up Todos
- None beyond the crash fix for this session; longer-term sentinel/documentation items remain in the inbox.
