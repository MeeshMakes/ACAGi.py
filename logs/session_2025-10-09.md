# Session Log — 2025-10-09

## Objective
- Implement a ScriptSpeak command parser within `ACAGi.py` that translates verbs/arguments/flags into event bus actions.
- Wire the parser into the Rationalizer and macro automation layers so automated flows can emit ScriptSpeak instructions.
- Validate bytecode compilation (`python -m compileall ACAGi.py`) and plan manual parsing tests.

## Context Recap
- Current branch `work`; remote `origin/main` is unavailable in this checkout (fetch succeeds but `origin/main` ref missing), so rebasing is blocked and noted here.
- `EventDispatcher` centralises pub/sub for `system.*`, `cortex.*`, etc.; macros (`MacroPlaybook`) serialize ScriptSpeak steps but currently lack a parser/dispatcher bridge.
- RationalizerManager submits jobs to CerebellumScheduler and publishes `cortex.intent` / `cortex.reference` events without ScriptSpeak encoding.

## File Notes
- `ACAGi.py` (~8k lines) houses event bus, macros, rationalizers, UI wiring; additions must include docstrings and logging per Agent manual.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps (Self-Prompt)
1. Design a `ScriptSpeakParser` helper that tokenizes verbs, `key=value` arguments, and `--flags`; produce structured commands and map to event dispatcher calls.
2. Embed parser access points where macros/rationalizers emit actions—ensure session logs capture emitted ScriptSpeak strings.
3. Update documentation or changelog entries reflecting ScriptSpeak support and record manual test checklist.
4. Run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`; document queued manual tests.

## Open Questions
- Need to confirm event topic naming conventions to map verbs → topics/actions before finalizing parser table.

## Work Log
- Drafted the ScriptSpeak parsing helper with verb/category lookup, shlex-based tokenisation, and session log journaling hooks.
- Wired macro playbook ingestion to rebuild MacroStep models and emit parsed ScriptSpeak commands on the `script.command` topic.
- Extended the Rationalizer manager to forward any ScriptSpeak payloads returned by workers into the shared dispatcher with job metadata.
- Updated durable memory with a new lesson describing the ScriptSpeak dispatch surface and recorded this implementation in the changelog.

## Validation Plan
- [x] `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`
- [ ] Manual parsing spot-checks:
  - Feed `CREATE_BUCKET title="Add parser" bucket=BKT-01 --dry-run` and confirm an event publishes with verb/arguments/flags recorded.
  - Trigger a mock macro payload containing ScriptSpeak steps and ensure dispatch events append to the session log tail.
  - Simulate a Rationalizer result with a `scriptspeak` array and verify each command is parsed without raising errors.
