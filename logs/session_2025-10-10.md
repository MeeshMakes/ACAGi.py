# Session Log — 2025-10-10

## Objective
Implement sentinel escalation for bridge loss, sandbox corruption, and repeated regressions while improving user-facing diagnostics.

## Context Snapshot
- Branch: work (detached from remote; `git diff origin/main...HEAD` unavailable — no origin remote configured).
- Key modules: `ACAGi.py` (sentinel + terminal subsystems), `Dev_Logic/` for operational documentation.
- Reference manuals reviewed: `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`.

## Notable References
- `ACAGi.py`: Sentinel monitor hub (~L7000), terminal health state handling (~L16680), status bar sandbox reporting (~L20220).

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Draft helper for emitting sentinel failure events that log, publish, and surface recovery guidance.
2. Integrate bridge loss and sandbox corruption detectors with LED updates, dialogs, and sentinel dispatch.
3. Enhance regression watcher to escalate repeated rollbacks and annotate logs/prompts.
4. Produce manual failure-injection checklist document and update CHANGELOG + memory as required.
5. Run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` and capture results for verification.
