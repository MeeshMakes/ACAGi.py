# Session Log â€” 2025-10-11

## Objective
Automate logic inbox processing during ACAGi startup and capture richer shutdown summaries across durable memory and session logs.

## Context Snapshot
- Branch: work (no upstream remote available; `git diff origin/main...HEAD` unavailable).
- Reviewed manuals: `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`, prior session logs.
- Key modules of interest: `ACAGi.py` memory services & shutdown coordinator, `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl` backlog.

## Notable References
- `ACAGi.py`: MemoryServices + InstructionInboxStore (~L11980-L12580), ShutdownCoordinator (~L12590-L12680), application `main()` (~L20860-L20940).
- `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`: pending directives.
- `memory/codex_memory.json`: durable lessons metadata.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Design a startup inbox processor that emits events or schedules task buckets while leaving unresolved instructions persisted.
2. Extend shutdown coordination to append structured success/failure summaries to both durable memory and the active session log, including anchor identifiers.
3. Update durable memory and changelog to reflect the new automation behavior; ensure session log captures validation strategy.
4. Implement code changes with thorough inline documentation, run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`, and outline manual verification steps for event/bucket dispatch.

## Validation
- `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`
- Manual: Inspect `vd_system.log` after a run for the "Logic inbox startup processing" summary and confirm the active session log gains a shutdown section with anchor listings.
