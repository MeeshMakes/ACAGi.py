# Session Log — 2025-10-08

## Objective
- Implement Task Bucket lifecycle orchestration in `ACAGi.py` so capture→note→bucketize→assemble→apply→test→verify→promote flows operate end-to-end with serialization on Apply/Test/Verify when buckets share file touch sets.
- Persist data structures, logging, and configuration required to monitor bucket stages.
- Record validation approach including `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` and enumerate manual/automated acceptance coverage for bucket flows.

## Context Highlights
- Reviewed `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`, and prior session logs to maintain verbose documentation standards and acknowledge pending directives (Sentinel runbook, Dev Logic templates, runtime settings work still open).
- Repository tracks branch `work` without a configured remote; synchronization with `origin/main` is not applicable.
- Existing `ACAGi.py` includes task models and event infrastructure but lacks explicit bucket lifecycle orchestration with file-touch aware serialization across apply/test/verify stages.
- No automated bucket acceptance tests currently exist; we will document manual flows and highlight any future test harness requirements.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps (Self-Prompt)
1. Design TaskBucket data classes capturing task metadata, touched files, stage timestamps, locks, and state transitions while integrating with the event dispatcher logging facilities.
2. Implement lifecycle handlers that execute capture→note→bucketize→assemble→apply→test→verify→promote steps, ensuring upstream steps run asynchronously while apply/test/verify enforce serialization for buckets that overlap file touch sets via a coordination manager.
3. Integrate new orchestration into existing task management infrastructure in `ACAGi.py`, updating docstrings and logging for visibility and resilience on failure cases.
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a new entry describing Task Bucket orchestration, and record the validation strategy in this session log and PR narrative.
5. Run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to confirm syntax, capture outputs for reporting, and list unit/manual acceptance tests relevant to the bucket flow.

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Exercise a dry-run of the bucket orchestration by simulating capture→promote transitions using mock tasks to ensure stage transitions and logging behave as expected (manual/diagnostic invocation).
- [ ] Confirm serialization manager defers apply/test/verify when overlapping file sets are in-flight, using logging to verify queueing behavior.
- [x] Run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to validate syntax after modifications.
- [x] Document acceptance coverage (unit or manual) for Task Bucket flows in the final report and `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Acceptance Tests
- **Manual Dry-Run:** Invoke `TaskBucketLifecycleRunner` with stub handlers that record execution order, ensuring the capture→note→bucketize→assemble→apply→test→verify→promote loop publishes stage telemetry on `task.bucket.stage`.
- **Manual Contention Check:** Execute two buckets with overlapping touched files and observe serialization logs to confirm Apply/Test/Verify stages acquire leases sequentially.
