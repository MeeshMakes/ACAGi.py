# Session Log â€” 2025-10-19

## Objective
- Address Windows elevation relaunch quoting bug in ACAGi.py.
- Add Windows-only unit test to verify argument preservation.
- Document change in CHANGELOG.md.

## Context
- Branch `work` without remote tracking; origin/main unavailable locally.
- `_ensure_windows_elevation` currently assembles relaunch command without robust quoting for spaced arguments.

## Notes from Canonical Artifacts
- Agent manual mandates verbose documentation and session logging.
- memory/logic_inbox.jsonl contains outstanding items unrelated to current task but notes pending manual smoke test for embedded Qt launch.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Inspect `_ensure_windows_elevation` implementation to determine current relaunch command construction.
2. Update logic to leverage `subprocess.list2cmdline` for Windows quoting.
3. Add Windows-only unit test ensuring spaced argument remains intact through relaunch.
4. Update CHANGELOG entry summarizing quoting fix.
5. Run available tests (note if platform limitations prevent Windows-only test execution).

## Unresolved Sub-Goals
- Confirm whether existing test harness supports Windows-specific skips on non-Windows platforms.
- Determine location for new unit test within repository.


## Outcome
- Replaced string-join relaunch parameters with `subprocess.list2cmdline` to keep quoting intact.
- Added Windows-only unit test that compiles `_ensure_windows_elevation` in isolation and verifies spaced arguments are preserved.
- Documented the change in `CHANGELOG.md` and noted testing constraints (skip on non-Windows).
