# Session 2025-10-19

## Objective
- Implement a shared Python runtime configuration helper and ensure every launcher validates interpreter compatibility while documenting the new knob.

## Internal Prompt
- "Create a central python_runtime helper that tracks supported version ranges and optional interpreter overrides, have entrypoints consult it at startup to relaunch if necessary, and update the README plus changelog with operator guidance."

## Context
- Repository has no configured remotes; documented failure of `git diff origin/main...HEAD` in prior session log persists.
- Reviewed `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, and the outstanding inbox item `2025-10-18-001` noting the need to smoke test embedded Qt launch scenarios.
- No AGENTS.md files beyond the root manual; default repository-wide coding standards apply.

## File Notes
- `tools/python_runtime.py`: Added shared interpreter policy helper that tracks
  supported version bounds, reads JSON/environment overrides, and relaunches the
  process via `os.execv` with loop guards.
- `ACAGi.py`, `Codex_Terminal.py`, `tools/logic_inbox.py`, `tools/codex_pr_sentinel.py`:
  Imported the runtime helper ahead of heavy imports so every launcher enforces
  the same interpreter selection policy.
- `README.md`: Documented environment variables and JSON configuration operators
  can use to customise the interpreter path or version window.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Logged the runtime helper addition and recorded the planned
  `python -m compileall` validation run.

## Validation
- `python -m compileall ACAGi.py Codex_Terminal.py tools`

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Design `tools/python_runtime.py` to expose supported version ranges and override resolution (env/config file).
2. Update `ACAGi.py`, `Codex_Terminal.py`, and any other entrypoints to enforce runtime validation and optional relaunching.
3. Document the new configuration knob in `README.md` and log the work in `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. Consider whether additional entrypoints require similar validation or tests.
