# Session Log â€” 2025-10-14

## Objective
- Restore ACAGi.py launch flow so that the environment boots, Codex Terminal surfaces correctly, and the Virtual Desktop dock plan remains intact.
- Resolve the `NameError` raised for `EVENT_DISPATCHER` during remote access controller initialisation.

## Context Snapshot
- git status: clean working tree on branch `work` (`git status -sb`).
- git log: recent merges from GitHub fetched into local branch (`git log -n 10 --oneline`).
- git remote: no remotes configured in the container; unable to sync with `origin/main` (documented limitation).
- git diff origin/main...HEAD: not executable without remote; defer until remote is available.

## Context Review
- Reviewed `AGENT.md` (v0.1.1) to reaffirm verbose implementation, documentation sync, and session logging mandates.
- Consulted `memory/codex_memory.json` for lessons on dispatcher telemetry, boot environment, terminal UI, and virtual desktop integration expectations.
- Examined `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`; pending directives remain open (sentinel runbook, Dev Logic template, settings dialog exposure, policy tests).
- Surveyed `Dev_Logic/` to understand assets for Codex Terminal and Virtual Desktop to ensure stylistic continuity.

## Key Artifacts / References
- `ACAGi.py`: monolithic application orchestrator experiencing launch regression.
- `Codex_Terminal.py`: reference for terminal desktop styling and behaviour.
- `Dev_Logic/Virtual_Desktop.py`: prior implementation slated for embedding into ACAGi runtime.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Trace module-level initialisation order within `ACAGi.py` to locate forward references leading to the `EVENT_DISPATCHER` NameError.
2. Reorder or refactor initialisation so dispatcher instantiation precedes remote access bootstrap while keeping documentation and comments verbose.
3. Validate that Codex Terminal and Virtual Desktop integration hooks remain referenced after adjustments; ensure no regressions to planned embedding points.
4. Update documentation artifacts (`CHANGELOG.md`, session log) if launch flow changes are material.
5. Execute available sanity checks (syntax, targeted tests) to confirm the application imports successfully.

## Open Questions / Risks
- Need to ensure moving dispatcher initialisation does not break other sections expecting late binding or module-level side effects.
- Confirm whether additional startup dependencies rely on the original ordering; update memory or inbox if new follow-up tasks emerge.

## Pending Inbox Items Impact
- No direct progress on outstanding logic inbox tasks; monitor for future opportunities while focusing on launch restoration.

## Work Notes
- Session initiated in offline container; remote sync steps recorded as blocked due to missing remotes.
- Context gathered from governance documents and Dev_Logic assets to preserve canonical styling for Codex Terminal and Virtual Desktop components.
