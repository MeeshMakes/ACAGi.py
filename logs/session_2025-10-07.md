# Session Log â€” 2025-10-07

## Objective
- Embed local-first Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) adapters directly into `ACAGi.py`, including streaming partial transcripts onto the event bus and barge-in handling that pauses synthesis when fresh speech arrives.
- Propagate speaker diarization or priority metadata into the Amygdala salience scoring pipeline so prioritization respects conversational context.
- Validate syntax via `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`, perform manual audio sanity checks, and document verification notes.

## Context Highlights
- Reviewed `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`, and prior session logs to stay aligned with verbose documentation, testing mandates, and pending directives (Sentinel runbook, Dev Logic template, runtime settings work remain open).
- Repository currently tracks branch `work` without a configured remote; no upstream diff comparison is available. Working tree is clean before changes.
- Existing audio pathway in `ACAGi.py` lacks integrated ASR/TTS adapters; event dispatcher publishes core system topics but does not yet carry live speech transcripts. Amygdala salience logic requires augmentation once located or scaffolded.
- Manual audio validation will rely on local playback and microphone inspection since automated tests for sound pipelines are not yet present.

## Key Reference Files
- `ACAGi.py`: Monolithic application module containing event bus, cognitive components, and UI wiring.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Versioned record for repository updates.
- `logs/session_2025-10-07.md`: This session log capturing objectives, context, and validation steps.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps (Self-Prompt)
1. Locate or scaffold the audio subsystem sections in `ACAGi.py`, drafting local ASR and TTS adapter classes with explicit logging, streaming callbacks, and barge-in support.
2. Wire adapters into the event dispatcher, ensuring partial ASR hypotheses publish incremental messages and the TTS pipeline pauses/resumes in response to ASR barge-in signals.
3. Surface diarization or speaker priority metadata through Amygdala salience scoring, adding configuration hooks and defensive fallbacks when metadata is absent.
4. Update related documentation (`CHANGELOG.md`, README snippets if needed) and record manual audio validation procedures.
5. Run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`, capture results, and describe manual audio verification outcomes in the final report and changelog.

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Trigger live microphone capture (or simulated audio) to confirm partial ASR transcripts stream via the event dispatcher topics while logging incremental hypotheses.
- [ ] Initiate TTS playback and speak over the audio to verify barge-in pauses/resumes synthesis promptly with clear log entries.
- [ ] Inspect Amygdala salience logs to ensure diarization metadata influences scoring weights as expected.
- [ ] Confirm `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` succeeds without syntax errors.
- [ ] Document manual audio checks performed during this session in the summary and changelog.
