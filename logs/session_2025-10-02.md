# Session Log — 2025-10-02

## Objective
- Refresh ACAGi's branding and guidance so the single-file integration point is clearly documented and status logs reference ACAGi instead of the legacy Codex Terminal name.

## Context
- Reviewed AGENT.md, codex memory, and the logic inbox to confirm governance requirements for verbose documentation, session logging, and changelog updates.
- Observed that ACAGi.py still opened with a Codex Terminal oriented docstring and contained crash/log messages referencing the retired name.

## Actions
- Replaced the module docstring with language that frames ACAGi as the authoritative one-file integration location for embedded subsystems.
- Updated top-of-file inline comments to emphasize the single-script mandate while retaining DPI setup notes.
- Refreshed status and error strings so user-facing crash logs and bootstrap telemetry refer to ACAGi; adjusted bundled PowerShell template output accordingly.
- Planned to document the branding refresh in CHANGELOG.md and run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to validate syntax.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Internal prompt: "Ensure ACAGi.py consistently presents itself as the single-entry module by updating documentation and status strings, then confirm syntax integrity via compileall."
- Verify other documentation (e.g., Dev_Logic references) for lingering Codex Terminal branding during subsequent passes.
- Progress pending logic inbox items on sentinel troubleshooting and Dev Logic templates when schedule allows.

## Session Update — 2025-10-02 (Import Consolidation)

### Objective
- Audit ACAGi.py sibling-module imports, inline the needed functionality into clearly labeled sections, and remove the now-redundant imports while preserving existing behavior.

### Context
- Reviewed AGENT.md, codex memory, and logic inbox items to align with verbose documentation, session logging, and single-file ownership standards.
- Confirmed remote branches are unavailable after `git fetch --all --prune`, so the workspace is already aligned with local `work` without an `origin/main` to rebase onto.
- Noted requirement to run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` post-refactor per task brief.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Internal prompt: "Trace each intra-repo import in ACAGi.py, transplant the necessary classes/functions into dedicated sections with provenance headers, remove the stale import statements, and re-run compileall to verify syntax."
- Inventory the imported names from tasks, background, and repository helper modules to plan consolidation order.
- Document any behavioral nuances from the inlined code via inline comments during migration.
- Update memory and changelog if consolidation introduces new standards worth preserving.
