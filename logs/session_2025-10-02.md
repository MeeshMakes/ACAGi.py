# Session Log — 2025-10-02

## Objective
- Refresh ACAGi's branding and guidance so the single-file integration point is clearly documented and status logs reference ACAGi instead of the legacy Codex Terminal name.

## Context
- Reviewed AGENT.md, codex memory, and the logic inbox to confirm governance requirements for verbose documentation, session logging, and changelog updates.
- Observed that ACAGi.py still opened with a Codex Terminal oriented docstring and contained crash/log messages referencing the retired name.

## Actions
- Replaced the module docstring with language that frames ACAGi as the authoritative one-file integration location for embedded subsystems.
- Updated top-of-file inline comments to emphasize the single-script mandate while retaining DPI setup notes.
- Refreshed status and error strings so user-facing crash logs and bootstrap telemetry refer to ACAGi; adjusted bundled PowerShell template output accordingly.
- Planned to document the branding refresh in CHANGELOG.md and run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to validate syntax.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Internal prompt: "Ensure ACAGi.py consistently presents itself as the single-entry module by updating documentation and status strings, then confirm syntax integrity via compileall."
- Verify other documentation (e.g., Dev_Logic references) for lingering Codex Terminal branding during subsequent passes.
- Progress pending logic inbox items on sentinel troubleshooting and Dev Logic templates when schedule allows.

## Session Update — 2025-10-02 (Import Consolidation)

### Objective
- Audit ACAGi.py sibling-module imports, inline the needed functionality into clearly labeled sections, and remove the now-redundant imports while preserving existing behavior.

### Context
- Reviewed AGENT.md, codex memory, and logic inbox items to align with verbose documentation, session logging, and single-file ownership standards.
- Confirmed remote branches are unavailable after `git fetch --all --prune`, so the workspace is already aligned with local `work` without an `origin/main` to rebase onto.
- Noted requirement to run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` post-refactor per task brief.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Internal prompt: "Trace each intra-repo import in ACAGi.py, transplant the necessary classes/functions into dedicated sections with provenance headers, remove the stale import statements, and re-run compileall to verify syntax."
- Inventory the imported names from tasks, background, and repository helper modules to plan consolidation order.
- Document any behavioral nuances from the inlined code via inline comments during migration.
- Update memory and changelog if consolidation introduces new standards worth preserving.

## Session Update — 2025-10-02 (Event Dispatcher Refresh)

### Objective
- Stand up a lightweight, reusable pub/sub dispatcher within ACAGi.py that registers human-observable topics (observation, note, task, etc.) and enforces subscriber backpressure controls.
- Wire dispatcher telemetry into the shared vd_system.log sink so event activity shows up beside existing system/process logs.
- Add minimal logging hooks to verify event flow, then validate syntax with `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`.

### Context
- Reviewed AGENT.md, repository memory, and the pending logic inbox to ground the task in current governance and outstanding directives.
- Confirmed the local branch lacks a remote `origin/main`, so rebase is not applicable after running `git fetch --all --prune`.
- Located the existing task-specific event bus in ACAGi.py; it currently lacks generalized topics and relies on synchronous dispatch without backpressure protections.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Internal prompt: "Design an EventDispatcher that registers default topics, exposes subscribe/publish APIs with queue-based backpressure, and mirrors events to the shared VirtualDesktop logger before running compileall."
- Create a dispatcher class with topic registration, subscription handles, and bounded queues per subscriber; ensure compatibility with existing publish/subscribe calls.
- Emit structured debug/info logs on subscribe, publish, and drop paths to confirm flow through vd_system.log during manual or future automated tests.
- Update CHANGELOG.md if the new dispatcher introduces noteworthy behavior changes worth documenting.

### Outcome
- Implemented an `EventDispatcher` with registered observation, note, task, and system topics plus bounded subscriber queues and remote throttling.
- Connected dispatcher logs to the shared `VirtualDesktop` logger and verified publish/subscription activity produces structured telemetry entries.
- Documented the change in `CHANGELOG.md`, updated codex memory with the dispatcher guidance, and ran `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to confirm syntax integrity.

## Session Update — 2025-10-02 (Memory + Dataset Persistence)

### Objective
- Stand up reusable memory services that hydrate durable lessons, the instruction inbox, and recent session tails on startup while exposing CRUD APIs for future automation.
- Rework dataset persistence so each entry uses a Git-safe JSONL core with optional local sidecars for embeddings and thumbnails anchored by metadata files.

### Context
- Reviewed `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, and `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl` to align with verbose documentation, governance requirements, and pending directives.
- Confirmed the local `work` branch lacks a configured `origin/main`, so the mandatory rebase step is inapplicable after `git status`/`git log` snapshots.
- Noted existing dataset manager embedded embeddings directly in JSONL entries and lacked sidecar metadata, making Git diffs noisy and losing anchor data.

### Actions
- Added `MemoryServices`, `DurableMemoryStore`, `InstructionInboxStore`, and `SessionTailStore` classes that load persistent lessons, instructions, and session JSONL tails during boot and provide CRUD helpers.
- Wired memory services into the boot sequence, ensured singleton initialization, and added module-level convenience wrappers for session notes.
- Implemented `DatasetNodePersistence` to manage JSONL cores plus vector/metadata/thumbnail sidecars and refactored `DatasetManager` to use anchors, metadata files, and optional thumbnail generation.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with the new memory/dataset capabilities and planned to run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` for syntax verification.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Extend UI surfaces to surface lesson/inbox/session data via the new memory services and add coverage for CRUD flows.
- Backfill migration helpers that retrofit existing dataset.jsonl entries by emitting sidecar metadata and vector files where missing.
- Consider caching embeddings to avoid repeated vector reads during frequent semantic searches.

## Session Update — 2025-10-02 (Dataset Manager Widget)

### Objective
- Introduce a dataset manager widget within ACAGi.py that lets users add files or directories and tag them into node datasets leveraging the Hippocampus APIs.
- Trigger semantic ingestion (OCR, embeddings, summaries) for newly added assets and register resulting nodes/edges for the 3D brain map.
- Validate syntax via `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` and document manual validation guidance.

### Context
- Re-read `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, and `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl` to align with verbose documentation, logging, and workflow expectations.
- Confirmed `git status -sb`, `git log -n 10 --oneline`, and `git fetch --all --prune` report no remote `origin/main`, so rebase is inapplicable for the current `work` branch.
- Reviewed Dev_Logic notes to ensure new UI widgets align with centralized ACAGi.py ownership and dataset persistence patterns introduced previously.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Internal prompt: "Design a dataset manager UI widget inside ACAGi.py that uses Hippocampus APIs to ingest tagged files/directories, kick off OCR/embedding/summary pipelines, and register nodes/edges in the brain map; capture manual test steps and verify syntax with compileall."
- Sketch widget responsibilities: selection dialog, dataset tagging, ingestion status display, and integration with DatasetNodePersistence/Hippocampus clients.
- Ensure ingestion pipeline hooks into existing semantic processors (OCR, embeddings, summaries) and brain map graph registration utilities.
- Plan documentation updates (CHANGELOG entry, manual test steps in session log) alongside required compileall validation.

### Manual Validation Steps
- Launch ACAGi via `python ACAGi.py`, open **View → Dataset Manager** to reveal the new dock.
- Use **Add Files…** to select a local text file; confirm the log shows an ingestion start message followed by a node summary.
- Repeat with **Add Directory…** against a folder containing images to verify OCR/vision notes appear in the log and child edges are listed.
- Inspect `sessions/<id>/hippocampus/brain_map.json` to confirm nodes and edges populate after ingestion.
