# Session Log — 2025-10-02

## Objective
- Refresh ACAGi's branding and guidance so the single-file integration point is clearly documented and status logs reference ACAGi instead of the legacy Codex Terminal name.

## Context
- Reviewed AGENT.md, codex memory, and the logic inbox to confirm governance requirements for verbose documentation, session logging, and changelog updates.
- Observed that ACAGi.py still opened with a Codex Terminal oriented docstring and contained crash/log messages referencing the retired name.

## Actions
- Replaced the module docstring with language that frames ACAGi as the authoritative one-file integration location for embedded subsystems.
- Updated top-of-file inline comments to emphasize the single-script mandate while retaining DPI setup notes.
- Refreshed status and error strings so user-facing crash logs and bootstrap telemetry refer to ACAGi; adjusted bundled PowerShell template output accordingly.
- Planned to document the branding refresh in CHANGELOG.md and run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to validate syntax.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Internal prompt: "Ensure ACAGi.py consistently presents itself as the single-entry module by updating documentation and status strings, then confirm syntax integrity via compileall."
- Verify other documentation (e.g., Dev_Logic references) for lingering Codex Terminal branding during subsequent passes.
- Progress pending logic inbox items on sentinel troubleshooting and Dev Logic templates when schedule allows.

## Session Update — 2025-10-02 (Import Consolidation)

### Objective
- Audit ACAGi.py sibling-module imports, inline the needed functionality into clearly labeled sections, and remove the now-redundant imports while preserving existing behavior.

### Context
- Reviewed AGENT.md, codex memory, and logic inbox items to align with verbose documentation, session logging, and single-file ownership standards.
- Confirmed remote branches are unavailable after `git fetch --all --prune`, so the workspace is already aligned with local `work` without an `origin/main` to rebase onto.
- Noted requirement to run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` post-refactor per task brief.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Internal prompt: "Trace each intra-repo import in ACAGi.py, transplant the necessary classes/functions into dedicated sections with provenance headers, remove the stale import statements, and re-run compileall to verify syntax."
- Inventory the imported names from tasks, background, and repository helper modules to plan consolidation order.
- Document any behavioral nuances from the inlined code via inline comments during migration.
- Update memory and changelog if consolidation introduces new standards worth preserving.

## Session Update — 2025-10-02 (Event Dispatcher Refresh)

### Objective
- Stand up a lightweight, reusable pub/sub dispatcher within ACAGi.py that registers human-observable topics (observation, note, task, etc.) and enforces subscriber backpressure controls.
- Wire dispatcher telemetry into the shared vd_system.log sink so event activity shows up beside existing system/process logs.
- Add minimal logging hooks to verify event flow, then validate syntax with `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`.

### Context
- Reviewed AGENT.md, repository memory, and the pending logic inbox to ground the task in current governance and outstanding directives.
- Confirmed the local branch lacks a remote `origin/main`, so rebase is not applicable after running `git fetch --all --prune`.
- Located the existing task-specific event bus in ACAGi.py; it currently lacks generalized topics and relies on synchronous dispatch without backpressure protections.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Internal prompt: "Design an EventDispatcher that registers default topics, exposes subscribe/publish APIs with queue-based backpressure, and mirrors events to the shared VirtualDesktop logger before running compileall."
- Create a dispatcher class with topic registration, subscription handles, and bounded queues per subscriber; ensure compatibility with existing publish/subscribe calls.
- Emit structured debug/info logs on subscribe, publish, and drop paths to confirm flow through vd_system.log during manual or future automated tests.
- Update CHANGELOG.md if the new dispatcher introduces noteworthy behavior changes worth documenting.

### Outcome
- Implemented an `EventDispatcher` with registered observation, note, task, and system topics plus bounded subscriber queues and remote throttling.
- Connected dispatcher logs to the shared `VirtualDesktop` logger and verified publish/subscription activity produces structured telemetry entries.
- Documented the change in `CHANGELOG.md`, updated codex memory with the dispatcher guidance, and ran `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to confirm syntax integrity.

## Session Update — 2025-10-02 (Memory + Dataset Persistence)

### Objective
- Stand up reusable memory services that hydrate durable lessons, the instruction inbox, and recent session tails on startup while exposing CRUD APIs for future automation.
- Rework dataset persistence so each entry uses a Git-safe JSONL core with optional local sidecars for embeddings and thumbnails anchored by metadata files.

### Context
- Reviewed `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, and `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl` to align with verbose documentation, governance requirements, and pending directives.
- Confirmed the local `work` branch lacks a configured `origin/main`, so the mandatory rebase step is inapplicable after `git status`/`git log` snapshots.
- Noted existing dataset manager embedded embeddings directly in JSONL entries and lacked sidecar metadata, making Git diffs noisy and losing anchor data.

### Actions
- Added `MemoryServices`, `DurableMemoryStore`, `InstructionInboxStore`, and `SessionTailStore` classes that load persistent lessons, instructions, and session JSONL tails during boot and provide CRUD helpers.
- Wired memory services into the boot sequence, ensured singleton initialization, and added module-level convenience wrappers for session notes.
- Implemented `DatasetNodePersistence` to manage JSONL cores plus vector/metadata/thumbnail sidecars and refactored `DatasetManager` to use anchors, metadata files, and optional thumbnail generation.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with the new memory/dataset capabilities and planned to run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` for syntax verification.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Extend UI surfaces to surface lesson/inbox/session data via the new memory services and add coverage for CRUD flows.
- Backfill migration helpers that retrofit existing dataset.jsonl entries by emitting sidecar metadata and vector files where missing.
- Consider caching embeddings to avoid repeated vector reads during frequent semantic searches.

## Session Update — 2025-10-02 (Dataset Manager Widget)

### Objective
- Introduce a dataset manager widget within ACAGi.py that lets users add files or directories and tag them into node datasets leveraging the Hippocampus APIs.
- Trigger semantic ingestion (OCR, embeddings, summaries) for newly added assets and register resulting nodes/edges for the 3D brain map.
- Validate syntax via `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` and document manual validation guidance.

### Context
- Re-read `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, and `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl` to align with verbose documentation, logging, and workflow expectations.
- Confirmed `git status -sb`, `git log -n 10 --oneline`, and `git fetch --all --prune` report no remote `origin/main`, so rebase is inapplicable for the current `work` branch.
- Reviewed Dev_Logic notes to ensure new UI widgets align with centralized ACAGi.py ownership and dataset persistence patterns introduced previously.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Internal prompt: "Design a dataset manager UI widget inside ACAGi.py that uses Hippocampus APIs to ingest tagged files/directories, kick off OCR/embedding/summary pipelines, and register nodes/edges in the brain map; capture manual test steps and verify syntax with compileall."
- Sketch widget responsibilities: selection dialog, dataset tagging, ingestion status display, and integration with DatasetNodePersistence/Hippocampus clients.
- Ensure ingestion pipeline hooks into existing semantic processors (OCR, embeddings, summaries) and brain map graph registration utilities.
- Plan documentation updates (CHANGELOG entry, manual test steps in session log) alongside required compileall validation.

### Manual Validation Steps
- Launch ACAGi via `python ACAGi.py`, open **View → Dataset Manager** to reveal the new dock.
- Use **Add Files…** to select a local text file; confirm the log shows an ingestion start message followed by a node summary.
- Repeat with **Add Directory…** against a folder containing images to verify OCR/vision notes appear in the log and child edges are listed.
- Inspect `sessions/<id>/hippocampus/brain_map.json` to confirm nodes and edges populate after ingestion.
## Session Update — 2025-10-02 (Terminal Widget Instrumentation)

### Objective
- Refactor the embedded Codex terminal widget so the health LED follows an explicit state machine, ready banners trigger a visible acknowledgement, approval prompts surface reliably, and tapping transcript bubbles writes memory events.
- Ensure transcript taps flow through Hippocampus to capture memory anchors and append corresponding events into the active session JSONL stream.
- Plan manual verification for LED transitions and approval workflows after running `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`.

### Context
- Reviewed `AGENT.md`, durable memory, and the logic inbox to stay aligned with verbose documentation, session logging, and governance requirements.
- `git status -sb` shows the local `work` branch with no pending changes; remote `origin/main` is unavailable so the mandated rebase step is inapplicable after the initial fetch attempt.
- Existing `ChatCard` wiring already exposes the LED widget, Codex bridge hooks, and approval prompt parsing, but lacks a formal LED state machine and any transcript tap integration.
- Hippocampus services are instantiated for the chat session yet are not currently leveraged for ad-hoc transcript captures.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Internal prompt: "Implement a TerminalHealthState enum plus helper that drives the LED, ready banner announcements, and interpreter toggle gating; enhance transcript bubbles so a click routes through Hippocampus to persist the tapped text and log a session JSONL event; verify syntax with compileall and capture manual test steps for LED/approval flows."
- Sketch the LED state machine transitions (off → starting → ready, plus error fallback) and define how they update tooltips and logs without spamming duplicates.
- Extend `ChatBubbleWidget` with a tap signal and handler that tolerates text selection while surfacing a Hippocampus-backed memory capture workflow in `ChatCard`.
- Add a Hippocampus helper that records transcript taps with anchor metadata and returns a snippet for system notices, then wire `_render_message`/`_handle_transcript_tap` to emit the corresponding session events.

### Manual Validation Plan
- Launch ACAGi and start the Codex bridge; confirm the LED logs a "Bridge warming up" notice, shows yellow while the console boots, and flips to green once the ready banner surfaces.
- Trigger a Codex approval prompt (e.g., request a privileged file write) and verify the inline widget appears, buttons send tokens, and the LED cycles yellow→green after the approval completes.
- Tap a user or assistant transcript bubble and ensure a `[Memory] Saved …` system notice appears with an anchor snippet while Hippocampus receives the full text.
## Session Update — 2025-10-02 (Brain Map Dock)

### Objective
- Introduce a dockable brain map widget that lazily renders Hippocampus nodes and typed edges with energy/salience overlays.
- Ensure interacting with brain map nodes activates the Virtual Desktop Dev Space for deeper analysis.
- Surface operator toggles for energy heatmap, queue depth, and error ray overlays while documenting manual rendering checks.

### Context
- Reviewed `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, and `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl` alongside Dev_Logic notes to respect verbose documentation and single-file ownership mandates.
- `git status -sb` confirms the `work` branch is clean; a remote `origin/main` is unavailable so `git diff origin/main...HEAD` fails (logged earlier).
- ACAGi already persists `hippocampus/brain_map.json` but lacks an interactive UI; Virtual Desktop Dev Space exposes diagnostics we can reuse when nodes are selected.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps (Self-Prompt)
1. Extend `VirtualDesktopDock` with a helper that focuses the Dev Space tab and logs node activation metadata.
2. Implement a `BrainMapDock` class that defers heavy graphics initialization until visible, polls the `BrainMapRegistry`, and renders nodes/edges with optional metric overlays.
3. Wire the new dock into `MainWindow`, add View menu toggles, and ensure the dock starts/stops a refresh timer based on visibility.
4. Capture manual rendering checks (visibility toggle, overlay switches, node→Dev Space hand-off) in this session log and run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` for syntax validation.

### Manual Rendering Checks
- [ ] Toggle **View → Brain Map** to confirm the dock lazily instantiates the scene and reports node/edge counts.
- [ ] Enable **Energy heatmap**, **Queue depth**, and **Error rays** toggles independently to verify overlays update without recreating the view.
- [ ] Click a node to ensure the Virtual Desktop dock becomes visible with the Dev Space tab focused and a log entry appended.
- [ ] Switch styles or settings and confirm the brain map registry reloads without raising exceptions.
## Session Update — 2025-10-02 (Rationalizer Manager Integration)

### Objective
- Introduce a Rationalizer manager responsible for spinning up short-lived workers that perform intent segmentation and reference resolution within ACAGi.py.
- Connect Rationalizer scheduling into the Cerebellum task scheduler so cognitive jobs are balanced with existing event workloads.
- Enforce Gate-provided energy quotas/backpressure so concurrent Rationalizers respect system limits, then validate syntax with `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`.

### Context
- Reviewed `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, and `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl` to stay aligned with verbose commentary, session logging, and pending directives.
- Confirmed the repository tracks branch `work` with no remote `origin/main`, so rebase against upstream is not applicable; previous attempts to diff `origin/main...HEAD` fail for this reason.
- Current ACAGi.py lacks a dedicated Rationalizer manager or Cerebellum scheduler hooks; Gate telemetry exists only as UI placeholders, so new coordination structures must be introduced carefully with extensive logging and documentation.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps (Self-Prompt)
1. Sketch data models for Rationalizer jobs (intent segmentation, reference resolution) and the worker lifecycle, including structured logging and timing metrics.
2. Implement a Cerebellum scheduler core that can accept queued Rationalizer tasks, manage worker threads, and expose telemetry back to Gate controls.
3. Build a RationalizerManager that requests work slots from Gate, spins up short-lived workers, publishes results through the event dispatcher, and releases quotas when work finishes or fails.
4. Wire the manager into the boot sequence and status telemetry feeds, ensuring Gate quotas/backpressure are enforced and log outputs reflect concurrency decisions.
5. Document behavior in `CHANGELOG.md`, update durable memory if new standards emerge, and validate syntax via `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`; outline concurrency test scenarios in this log for future execution.

### Validation Plan
- [ ] Run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to confirm syntax integrity.
- [ ] Describe a set of manual/automated concurrency stress tests for Rationalizer backpressure in this session log and final summary.
- [ ] Capture event/log telemetry expectations for Rationalizer scheduling decisions.

### Concurrency Test Outline
- [ ] Warm start ACAGi, send five rapid user utterances with varying reference suggestions, and confirm logs show Gate permits at most the configured Rationalizer slots while queue depth grows without exceeding limits.
- [ ] Artificially lower the Cerebellum queue limit via settings reload to ensure submissions beyond the cap emit queue-full warnings and publish drop telemetry on `system.metrics`.
- [ ] Temporarily set the Rationalizer limit to zero and verify user messages log Gate rejections without launching workers, then restore limits and confirm jobs resume.
## Session Update — 2025-10-02 (Bucket Coder/Test/Verifier Telemetry)

### Objective
- Extend bucket apply/test/verify pipelines so coder output includes anchored patches with rationales, downstream tests attach validation results, and verifier updates telemetry for downstream UI consumers.
- Ensure bucket-stage failures loop context through the Rationalizer manager and persist the latest learning snapshot for future operators.

### Context
- Reviewed `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`, the `Dev_Logic/` tree, and `Archived Conversation/` assets to align with verbose documentation, monolithic ownership, and task-bucket orchestration standards.
- `git fetch --all --prune` succeeded; the repository lacks `origin/main`, so the mandated `git rebase origin/main` and `git diff origin/main...HEAD` steps continue to fail and are noted for traceability.
- Task bucket lifecycle scaffolding exists in `ACAGi.py`, but the coder/test/verifier handlers are unimplemented and error handling does not yet inform the Rationalizer loop or memory services.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Internal prompt: "Implement bucket apply/test/verify handlers that capture git patches with rationales, execute configured validations, broadcast telemetry, and surface failure context to Rationalizers while persisting a learning snapshot."
- Design anchored patch dataclasses and helper utilities that normalise diff capture, touched-file resolution, and rationale generation for coder output.
- Extend the test handler to normalise validation command metadata, capture stdout/stderr artefacts, and mark failures while updating bucket metadata for downstream consumers.
- Wire a verifier handler that consolidates patches and validation telemetry, publishing a `task.bucket.telemetry` payload the UI can subscribe to.
- Update `TaskBucketLifecycleRunner` failure handling so Rationalizers receive a summarised job and MemoryServices stores the latest bucket failure learning.

### Manual Regression Scenarios
- [ ] Trigger a bucket apply stage with staged workspace changes and confirm a `task.diff` event includes the anchored patch metadata.
- [ ] Configure multiple validation commands (pass + fail) and ensure the test stage records stdout/stderr and marks bucket telemetry appropriately.
- [ ] Force a test failure to verify the Rationalizer queue receives a failure summary and `codex_memory.json` updates the staged-learning entry.
- [ ] Complete a successful apply→test→verify sequence and inspect telemetry updates on the status bar/task drawer when available.
