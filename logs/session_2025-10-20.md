# Session Log â€” 2025-10-20

## Objective
- Introduce a reusable interpreter normalization helper that relaunches entrypoints under the configured Python runtime.
- Wire the helper into ACAGi.py, Codex_Terminal.py, and the Agent_Codex_Standalone entry scripts so they bootstrap with a consistent interpreter.
- Document interpreter configuration workflow across README and governance artifacts.

## Context
- Local branch `work` without remote tracking; unable to diff against `origin/main` (no remote configured).
- Repository mandates verbose documentation, session logging, and governance sync via `AGENT.md`.
- memory/logic_inbox.jsonl still lists pending smoke test for embedded Qt launch; current task is orthogonal but must avoid regressing boot flow.
- Need to create a new helper under tools/ while respecting repository logging and import standards.

## Notes from Canonical Artifacts
- `AGENT.md` emphasises rich commentary, session logging, and documenting behavioural changes in CHANGELOG and READMEs.
- `memory/codex_memory.json` highlights boot environment centralization and shared helpers reused across entrypoints.
- `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl` contains no interpreter-related directives but signals ongoing attention to startup sequencing.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Review existing startup code paths in ACAGi.py, Codex_Terminal.py, and Agent_Codex_Standalone scripts to understand import order requirements.
2. Design the `tools/python_runtime.py` helper: load desired interpreter (from env/config), compare against `sys.executable` / `sys.version_info`, and relaunch via subprocess if mismatched.
3. Add instrumentation and logging to explain relaunch decisions and failure handling.
4. Integrate the helper at the top of each entry script prior to other heavy imports, ensuring idempotent behaviour to avoid relaunch loops.
5. Update README.md and memory/logic_inbox.jsonl with interpreter configuration guidance.
6. Run available sanity checks (e.g., lint placeholder) and document any limitations.

## Unresolved Sub-Goals
- Confirm whether repository already exposes configuration files for interpreter selection or if new config stub is needed.
- Decide how to persist new governance guidance in CHANGELOG/Agent manual if interpreter normalization alters workflows.
