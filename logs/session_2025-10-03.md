# Session Log – 2025-10-03

## Objective
- Inline task, error handling, background, and repository helper subsystems into `ACAGi.py` while preserving behavior.
- Remove now-redundant intra-package imports and reorganize `ACAGi.py` with clear section headers.
- Run project tests (via `tools/manage_tests.py` or equivalent) to validate the monolithic configuration.

## Context Review
- Reviewed `AGENT.md` v0.1.0 for operational directives, emphasizing verbose narration and documentation updates.
- Consulted `memory/codex_memory.json` for stable lessons (verbose implementations, logging discipline, optional dependency policy).
- Checked `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`; pending tasks about sentinel runbook and Dev Logic templates remain unresolved for future sessions.
- Enumerated `Dev_Logic/` resources; noted numerous subsystem modules (e.g., `tasks`, `error_console.py`, `background`, `repo_reference_helper.py`) slated for inlining.

## Key Artifacts / References
- `ACAGi.py`: primary orchestrator to be expanded.
- `Dev_Logic/tasks/`, `Dev_Logic/error_console.py`, `Dev_Logic/background/`, `Dev_Logic/repo_reference_helper.py`: source implementations for inlining.
- Testing utilities under `tools/`, notably `tools/manage_tests.py`.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Inspect current `ACAGi.py` to understand import points and integration touchpoints with external modules.
2. Open each referenced module (`tasks`, `error_console`, `background`, `repo_reference_helper`, etc.) to document required classes/functions.
3. Draft sections within `ACAGi.py` with descriptive headers/docstrings, replicating functionality inline and adapting references.
4. Remove redundant imports and ensure namespace consistency.
5. Run the mandated test suite (`python tools/manage_tests.py` or equivalent) and capture results.
6. Update documentation artifacts (`CHANGELOG.md`, potentially README) to reflect monolithic refactor.

## Open Questions / Risks
- Need to confirm whether other modules depend on the same helpers; ensure no duplicated definitions cause divergence.
- Validate that removing package imports does not break dynamic loading logic elsewhere in `ACAGi.py`.

## Pending Inbox Items Impact
- No direct progress on sentinel runbook or Dev Logic template; remain queued.

## Work Notes
- Inlined the task data models, bus, diff capture, TaskPanel/TaskDrawer UI, error console, background engines, and repository helper directly into `ACAGi.py` with dedicated section headers and docstrings for each subsystem.
- Removed redundant imports from the former Dev_Logic modules and retained optional dependency guards for multimedia, OpenGL, and repository indexing.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` and `memory/codex_memory.json` to document the architectural shift toward the monolithic file.

## Tests & Validation
- `python -m py_compile $(git ls-files '*.py')`
- `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen pytest`
- `python Dev_Logic/tools/manage_tests.py`
- `python tools/logic_inbox.py validate memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`
- `flake8` *(missing; command unavailable in container)*

## Session Entry – 2025-10-17 (Follow-up Investigation)

### Objective
- Diagnose why the primary launch script fails to start and restore a working startup sequence for `ACAGi.py`.
- Ensure all governance prerequisites are met (context capture, logging, testing) while addressing the launch regression.
- Document findings, update durable memory if new lessons emerge, and prepare a merge-ready branch.

### Context Review Highlights
- Revisited `AGENT.md` v0.1.1 for verbose implementation and testing mandates.
- Parsed `memory/codex_memory.json` to reconfirm boot environment lessons (BootEnvironment manager, high-DPI guard) relevant to startup issues.
- Checked `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`; existing dispatched items remain untouched for this session.
- Attempted `git diff origin/main...HEAD` per protocol; noted failure because `origin/main` is unavailable in the container (no remote configured).

### Self-Prompt & Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Reproduce the launch failure by executing the documented entry point (`python ACAGi.py`) and capture stack traces.
2. Inspect `ACAGi.py` initialization flow—especially BootEnvironment and Qt setup—for missing guards or incorrect ordering.
3. Cross-reference supporting modules (`Codex_Terminal.py`, `Agent_Codex_Standalone/`, `Dev_Logic/`) for dependencies invoked during launch.
4. Implement corrective changes with rich inline commentary, ensuring optional dependencies remain gracefully handled.
5. Run available tests or at minimum `python -m py_compile` on touched modules; log unavailable tooling.
6. Update `CHANGELOG.md` and prepare PR narrative via `make_pr`.

### Open Questions / Risks
- Does the crash stem from Qt platform plugin issues in headless environments? Need to confirm environment variables.
- Are there stale imports referencing removed modules during prior refactors?

### TODO Mirror
- If the fix requires follow-up automation (e.g., sentinel tests), add new entries to `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl` before session close.


### Execution Notes
- Observed `ModuleNotFoundError: PySide6` when launching `python ACAGi.py`.
- Added an import-time guard using `importlib.util.find_spec` to log actionable
  installation instructions and exit cleanly when PySide6 is unavailable.
- Adjusted optional dependency detection for Pillow to probe the base `PIL`
  package, preventing `ModuleNotFoundError` cascades during the guard checks.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` (v0.1.33) and appended a stable lesson to
  `memory/codex_memory.json` documenting the new PySide6 bootstrap policy.

### Validation
- `python ACAGi.py` *(logs PySide6 guidance; returns exit code 1)*
- `python -m py_compile ACAGi.py`
