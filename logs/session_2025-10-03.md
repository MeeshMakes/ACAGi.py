# Session Log — 2025-10-03 (Elevation Helper)

## Objective
- Implement Windows elevation helper for ACAGi.py startup per latest request.
- Maintain repository governance artifacts (CHANGELOG, memory/inbox review).

## Context Snapshot
- Branch: `work` (no upstream configured).
- `git status`: clean before changes.
- `git log -n 10 --oneline`: captured recent history (see terminal chunk ca4449).
- `git diff origin/main...HEAD`: unavailable because no `origin` remote is configured.
- Remote configuration: `git remote -v` returned no remotes.
- Dependencies: PySide6 expected but not installed in container; GUI launch not attempted this session.

## Self-Prompt & Validation Plan
- Add helper near entrypoint detecting Windows platform and checking elevation via `ctypes.windll.shell32.IsUserAnAdmin()`.
- On missing elevation, relaunch with `ShellExecuteW` using `runas` verb, forwarding arguments and setting `ACAGI_ELEVATED=1` to avoid recursion; exit afterward.
- Invoke helper at the top of `main()` before constructing the Qt application.
- Update CHANGELOG and document code with rationale-rich comments.
- Validation: run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to ensure syntax correctness; manual GUI test omitted (no PySide6).

## Files of Interest
- `ACAGi.py`: Windows elevation helper additions near entrypoint.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Document new behavior.

## Logic Inbox Review
- Pending (dispatched): Sentinel troubleshooting runbook, Dev Logic template, settings dialog work, settings loader tests/rebinding, sentinel enforcement tests.
- Pending (new): Smoke test embedded Qt launch path — not addressed this session.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
- After implementing helper, consider adding unit coverage for elevation guard when Windows CI environment available.
- Follow up on `2025-10-18-001` inbox item with manual Qt launch verification in GUI-capable environment.

## Outstanding Questions
- None identified; Windows-specific behavior to be validated by operators on target OS.

# Session Log – 2025-10-03

## Objective
- Inline task, error handling, background, and repository helper subsystems into `ACAGi.py` while preserving behavior.
- Remove now-redundant intra-package imports and reorganize `ACAGi.py` with clear section headers.
- Run project tests (via `tools/manage_tests.py` or equivalent) to validate the monolithic configuration.

## Context Review
- Reviewed `AGENT.md` v0.1.0 for operational directives, emphasizing verbose narration and documentation updates.
- Consulted `memory/codex_memory.json` for stable lessons (verbose implementations, logging discipline, optional dependency policy).
- Checked `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`; pending tasks about sentinel runbook and Dev Logic templates remain unresolved for future sessions.
- Enumerated `Dev_Logic/` resources; noted numerous subsystem modules (e.g., `tasks`, `error_console.py`, `background`, `repo_reference_helper.py`) slated for inlining.

## Key Artifacts / References
- `ACAGi.py`: primary orchestrator to be expanded.
- `Dev_Logic/tasks/`, `Dev_Logic/error_console.py`, `Dev_Logic/background/`, `Dev_Logic/repo_reference_helper.py`: source implementations for inlining.
- Testing utilities under `tools/`, notably `tools/manage_tests.py`.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Inspect current `ACAGi.py` to understand import points and integration touchpoints with external modules.
2. Open each referenced module (`tasks`, `error_console`, `background`, `repo_reference_helper`, etc.) to document required classes/functions.
3. Draft sections within `ACAGi.py` with descriptive headers/docstrings, replicating functionality inline and adapting references.
4. Remove redundant imports and ensure namespace consistency.
5. Run the mandated test suite (`python tools/manage_tests.py` or equivalent) and capture results.
6. Update documentation artifacts (`CHANGELOG.md`, potentially README) to reflect monolithic refactor.

## Open Questions / Risks
- Need to confirm whether other modules depend on the same helpers; ensure no duplicated definitions cause divergence.
- Validate that removing package imports does not break dynamic loading logic elsewhere in `ACAGi.py`.

## Pending Inbox Items Impact
- No direct progress on sentinel runbook or Dev Logic template; remain queued.

## Work Notes
- Inlined the task data models, bus, diff capture, TaskPanel/TaskDrawer UI, error console, background engines, and repository helper directly into `ACAGi.py` with dedicated section headers and docstrings for each subsystem.
- Removed redundant imports from the former Dev_Logic modules and retained optional dependency guards for multimedia, OpenGL, and repository indexing.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` and `memory/codex_memory.json` to document the architectural shift toward the monolithic file.

## Tests & Validation
- `python -m py_compile $(git ls-files '*.py')`
- `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen pytest`
- `python Dev_Logic/tools/manage_tests.py`
- `python tools/logic_inbox.py validate memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`
- `flake8` *(missing; command unavailable in container)*

## Session Entry – 2025-10-17 (Follow-up Investigation)

### Objective
- Diagnose why the primary launch script fails to start and restore a working startup sequence for `ACAGi.py`.
- Ensure all governance prerequisites are met (context capture, logging, testing) while addressing the launch regression.
- Document findings, update durable memory if new lessons emerge, and prepare a merge-ready branch.

### Context Review Highlights
- Revisited `AGENT.md` v0.1.1 for verbose implementation and testing mandates.
- Parsed `memory/codex_memory.json` to reconfirm boot environment lessons (BootEnvironment manager, high-DPI guard) relevant to startup issues.
- Checked `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`; existing dispatched items remain untouched for this session.
- Attempted `git diff origin/main...HEAD` per protocol; noted failure because `origin/main` is unavailable in the container (no remote configured).

### Self-Prompt & Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Reproduce the launch failure by executing the documented entry point (`python ACAGi.py`) and capture stack traces.
2. Inspect `ACAGi.py` initialization flow—especially BootEnvironment and Qt setup—for missing guards or incorrect ordering.
3. Cross-reference supporting modules (`Codex_Terminal.py`, `Agent_Codex_Standalone/`, `Dev_Logic/`) for dependencies invoked during launch.
4. Implement corrective changes with rich inline commentary, ensuring optional dependencies remain gracefully handled.
5. Run available tests or at minimum `python -m py_compile` on touched modules; log unavailable tooling.
6. Update `CHANGELOG.md` and prepare PR narrative via `make_pr`.

### Open Questions / Risks
- Does the crash stem from Qt platform plugin issues in headless environments? Need to confirm environment variables.
- Are there stale imports referencing removed modules during prior refactors?

### TODO Mirror
- If the fix requires follow-up automation (e.g., sentinel tests), add new entries to `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl` before session close.


### Execution Notes
- Observed `ModuleNotFoundError: PySide6` when launching `python ACAGi.py`.
- Added an import-time guard using `importlib.util.find_spec` to log actionable
  installation instructions and exit cleanly when PySide6 is unavailable.
- Adjusted optional dependency detection for Pillow to probe the base `PIL`
  package, preventing `ModuleNotFoundError` cascades during the guard checks.
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` (v0.1.33) and appended a stable lesson to
  `memory/codex_memory.json` documenting the new PySide6 bootstrap policy.

### Validation
- `python ACAGi.py` *(logs PySide6 guidance; returns exit code 1)*
- `python -m py_compile ACAGi.py`

---
### Objective (2025-10-03 Session: Codex Terminal DPI Guard Refactor)
- Align `Codex_Terminal.py` with the central Qt DPI guard implementation shared with `ACAGi.py`.
- Ensure the helper never executes after a Qt application is active and restrict its invocation to QApplication bootstrap.
- Maintain governance artifacts (context capture, testing, PR narrative) for a merge-ready branch.

### Context Review Highlights
- Re-read `AGENT.md` v0.1.1 to reaffirm verbose documentation and testing expectations plus commit/PR protocol.
- Parsed `memory/codex_memory.json` for the "High DPI Policy Guard" lesson guiding guard reuse.
- Inspected `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`; noted item `2025-10-18-002` (Factor Qt bootstrap helper) is directly relevant.
- Attempted `git diff origin/main...HEAD` per protocol; unable to complete because no git remotes are configured in this workspace.

### Self-Prompt & Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Inspect `ACAGi.py` and `Codex_Terminal.py` to understand the shared DPI guard implementation and current usage.
2. Refactor `Codex_Terminal.py` to import or replicate the guarded helper with a shared flag so it stays idempotent across modules.
3. Relocate the helper invocation to the QApplication creation path, ensuring it executes immediately before instantiating `QApplication`.
4. Run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py/Codex_Terminal.py` to satisfy the testing mandate and confirm syntax integrity.
5. Update documentation or memory entries if the refactor surfaces new stable practices for Qt bootstrap reuse.
6. Commit the changes, generate the PR summary via `make_pr`, and mirror any outstanding follow-ups back into the logic inbox.

### Open Questions / Risks
- Need to confirm whether `Codex_Terminal.py` can import the helper without circular dependencies; fallback plan is a mirrored guard with a shared module-level flag.
- Ensure the helper respects existing Qt instances (QCore/QGui/QApplication) to avoid runtime errors when the script runs inside embedded hosts.

### TODO Mirror
- Pending logic inbox items remain unchanged; revisit `2025-10-18-002` after implementing shared helper logic to decide if it can be marked addressed.

# Session Log — 2025-10-03 (Style Parity)

## Objective
- Ensure the primary ACAGi launcher renders with the same visual styling as Codex_Terminal.
- Capture context from governance artifacts and prior logs before modifying UI assets.
- Plan validation to confirm theme parity without a runnable GUI in the container.

## Context Snapshot
- Branch: `work` (no upstream remote configured).
- `git status`: clean at session start (chunk eb77d7).
- `git log -n 10 --oneline`: captured recent history (chunk 06b7b4).
- `git diff origin/main...HEAD`: unavailable because `origin/main` does not exist (chunk ee67d4).
- Runtime GUI dependencies (PySide6, etc.) are not installed in the container; styling changes must be validated via static inspection.

## Notes from Canonical Artifacts
- `AGENT.md` mandates verbose intent logging, CHANGELOG updates, and reuse of shared helpers for desktop boot flows.
- `memory/codex_memory.json` emphasises monolithic ownership of UI components within ACAGi.py and reuse of shared helpers across entrypoints.
- `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl` lists outstanding items unrelated to style parity but flags an upcoming embedded Qt smoke test that should remain unaffected.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Inspect ACAGi.py and Codex_Terminal.py theme loaders to identify where shared style assets should live.
2. Introduce a repository-tracked `Styles/advanced_styles.json` so both entrypoints resolve the same theme file without manual setup.
3. Update CHANGELOG and documentation to reflect the new bundled style asset and add static validation (e.g., `python -m compileall`).

## Unresolved Sub-Goals
- Future enhancement: factor shared theme definitions into a dedicated helper to reduce duplication across entrypoints.
- Confirm on a real workstation that the bundled JSON restores Codex Terminal gradients when PySide6 is available.
