# Session Log â€” 2025-10-04

## Objective
- Implement runtime settings loader for ACAGi, integrate feature flags into event bus, sentinel, and UI, and document schema.

## Context Highlights
- Reviewed AGENT.md, memory, and logic inbox for governance and pending directives.
- Current branch `work`; no remote `origin/main` available for diff baseline.

## Key File Touchpoints
- `ACAGi.py`: Added `SettingsLoader`, runtime feature propagation, sentinel wiring, and status bar updates.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Recorded 0.1.5 release notes summarizing loader and flag propagation.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Extend settings dialog to expose new loader-backed toggles (offline, sandbox level, remote URLs).
- Add automated tests covering `SettingsLoader` parsing and sentinel/event bus integration.
- Evaluate workspace override workflow to refresh runtime settings path dynamically.
