# Session Log — 2025-10-04

## Objective
- Implement runtime settings loader for ACAGi, integrate feature flags into event bus, sentinel, and UI, and document schema.

## Context Highlights
- Reviewed AGENT.md, memory, and logic inbox for governance and pending directives.
- Current branch `work`; no remote `origin/main` available for diff baseline.

## Key File Touchpoints
- `ACAGi.py`: Added `SettingsLoader`, runtime feature propagation, sentinel wiring, and status bar updates.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Recorded 0.1.5 release notes summarizing loader and flag propagation.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Extend settings dialog to expose new loader-backed toggles (offline, sandbox level, remote URLs).
- Add automated tests covering `SettingsLoader` parsing and sentinel/event bus integration.
- Evaluate workspace override workflow to refresh runtime settings path dynamically.

## Session – Sentinel policy wiring

### Objective
- Implement event-bus Sentinel monitors that surface loop/regression/stall immune responses and wire policies.json enforcement into command safety checks.

### Context Highlights
- `ACAGi.py` SafetyManager currently only matches regex-based risky commands; it must understand operation policies for coder/test flows.
- Event dispatcher publishes task/status metrics but lacks Sentinel observers to translate anomalies into actionable responses.
- Runtime settings loader persists ini values but does not yet broker JSON policy bundles.

### Key File Touchpoints
- `ACAGi.py` — expand SafetyManager, SettingsLoader, and event dispatcher sections.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — capture sentinel monitor + policy enforcement update.
- `policies.json` — seed versioned policy defaults for operations.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Define Sentinel monitor hub subscribing to task/status topics, detecting loops/regressions/stalls, and publishing immune responses with rationale.
2. Extend SettingsLoader to source policies.json, produce structured policy objects, and push them into SafetyManager.
3. Update SafetyManager/run_checked to enforce allow/deny/approval/sandbox requirements for coder/test operations.
4. Document changes in CHANGELOG and ensure policy defaults exist on disk.
5. Run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` and log manual Sentinel trigger guidance.

### Progress Notes
- Added SentinelMonitorHub wiring to event dispatcher with cooldown/quarantine/rollback responses logged to `system.immune`.
- Extended SafetyManager and SettingsLoader to parse `policies.json` and gate coder/test operations via allow/deny/approval checks.
- Seeded repository `policies.json` template and documented the change in `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Manual Sentinel Trigger Plan
- Use `trigger_manual_immune_response(task_id, ImmuneResponse.<type>, reason, notes)` when an operator needs to escalate outside automated heuristics.
- Manual triggers bypass backoff but still publish to `system.immune` with sandbox/policy metadata for auditing.
- Pair manual triggers with session log annotations referencing the rationale and targeted recovery step.

### Verification Checklist
- Run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` to ensure syntax integrity.
- Exercise a sample coder command via `run_coder_command(["pytest", "-q"], operation context only)` inside a sandbox to observe allowlist approvals.
