# Session Log â€” 2025-10-06

## Objective
- Extend the ACAGi main window status bar with dedicated widgets for remote toggle, sandbox posture, resource meters, attention distribution, and OCR duty cycle telemetry.
- Subscribe to Gate/Scheduler telemetry from the Thalamus bus so the widgets reflect live dispatcher updates.
- Validate syntax via `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` and document telemetry verification guidance.

## Context Highlights
- Reviewed `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, and `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl` to reaffirm verbose documentation, testing, and logging standards.
- Repository is on branch `work` without a configured `origin`, so upstream diffs cannot be produced; `git fetch --all --prune` executed successfully.
- Gate/Scheduler telemetry currently lands on the `system.metrics` topic; existing docks capture snapshots but the status bar only renders static text.
- Pending logic inbox directives (Sentinel runbook, Dev Logic template, runtime settings follow-ups) remain outstanding.

## Key Reference Files
- `ACAGi.py`: main application module where status bar construction and event subscriptions live.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: records repository-level versioned updates.
- `logs/session_2025-10-06.md`: this session record for objectives, context, and validation plans.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps (Self-Prompt)
1. Inspect existing status bar initialization inside `MainWindow` to design modular widgets for remote, sandbox, resource, attention, and OCR telemetry indicators.
2. Define data classes or helper methods to normalise Gate/Scheduler telemetry payloads arriving via the Thalamus `system.metrics` topic.
3. Wire new `MainWindow` subscriptions that forward telemetry snapshots into the status bar widgets with thread-safe UI updates.
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a new entry documenting the status bar instrumentation and telemetry validation approach.
5. Run `python -m compileall ACAGi.py`, record results, and describe telemetry validation steps in the final summary.

## Telemetry Validation Checklist
- [ ] Publish a synthetic `system.metrics` payload (CPU/RAM/attention/OCR fields) and verify each status bar widget updates without UI freezes.
- [ ] Toggle the remote fan-out button to confirm the dispatcher pauses/resumes `_fan_out_remote` activity and the tooltip reflects the new state.
- [ ] Switch sandbox posture in settings and ensure the status bar label updates immediately after returning from the dialog.
- [ ] Confirm compile-time validation via `python -m compileall ACAGi.py` remains green after telemetry wiring.
