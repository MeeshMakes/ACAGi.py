## Objective
- Integrate the revised Qt high-DPI policy guard so launchers defer configuration until immediately before QApplication construction while avoiding redundant retries in embedded hosts.

## Internal Prompt
- "Tighten the high-DPI helper so we only call it right before QApplication(), mark skips as applied, and bail out cleanly if another Qt app already exists. Validate with compileall."

## Context
- Reviewed Git history and discovered prior guard adjustments in commits 689b5cc and 1dca9d3; used them as background for safe sequencing.
- Attempted to diff against origin/main but repository has no remote (`git diff origin/main...HEAD` failed), noted for future sync steps.
- Verified durable guidance in `memory/codex_memory.json` emphasizing verbose rationale and DPI guard behaviours.

## File Notes
- `ACAGi.py`: Updated `_ensure_high_dpi_rounding_policy()` to set `_HIGH_DPI_POLICY_APPLIED` for all intentional skips and on exit, removed module-level invocation, and moved the helper call into `main()` immediately before QApplication construction with an early-return path for embedded hosts.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Smoke test embedded launch scenarios where ACAGi is imported into an existing Qt host to confirm the early-return logging keeps the parent process stable.
- Consider extracting the DPI/environment bootstrap into a reusable function if additional entrypoints appear so code stays synchronized.
