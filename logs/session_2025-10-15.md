# Session Log — 2025-10-15

## Objective
- Reorder the `EVENT_DISPATCHER` instantiation in `ACAGi.py` ahead of the `REMOTE_ACCESS` guard to resolve import-time `NameError`s.
- Verify helper functions remain valid after the reorder and confirm the application launches cleanly via `python ACAGi.py`.

## Context Snapshot
- git status: clean working tree on branch `work` (`git status`).
- git log: inspected recent history to understand dispatcher-related commits (`git log -n 10 --oneline`).
- git diff origin/main...HEAD: cannot execute because no `origin` remote is configured; documented as a limitation for this environment.

## Context Review
- Reviewed `AGENT.md` (v0.1.1) for verbose implementation, documentation sync, and session logging requirements.
- Re-read `memory/codex_memory.json` to recall dispatcher telemetry, boot environment, and logger ordering lessons.
- Checked `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl`; noted outstanding directives remain pending and unchanged for this task.
- Surveyed repository structure to ensure no nested `AGENT.md` overrides the top-level guidance.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
1. Inspect `ACAGi.py` around the current `EVENT_DISPATCHER` definition and the `REMOTE_ACCESS` guard to understand existing dependencies.
2. Relocate the dispatcher instantiation above the guard, adjusting helper definitions or forward references as needed.
3. Run `python ACAGi.py` to confirm startup succeeds without `NameError` regressions.
4. Stage, test, and prepare commit plus PR metadata after ensuring documentation requirements are satisfied.

## Work Log
- Identified that `remote_access_controller()` and `remote_access_snapshot()` were defined ahead of the dispatcher singleton
  despite module-level initialisation relying on the dispatcher first.
- Relocated the dispatcher helper functions to live after the singleton definition so the `REMOTE_ACCESS` guard executes with the
  dispatcher already initialised, preserving the documented boot order.
- Updated the changelog to record the boot-order correction and validation command per governance policy.

## Validation
- `python ACAGi.py` *(fails: container lacks `PySide6`; the dispatcher initialisation path is reached without raising `NameError`)*

## Follow-ups / Risks
- Capture the `PySide6` runtime dependency gap for future container provisioning work if GUI validation becomes necessary.
- Monitor for any additional helpers that assume the previous ordering and add them to the logic inbox if discovered in later sessions.

## Addendum Session – 2025-10-15

### Objective
- Resolve the `flush_pending_sentinel_events` import-order `NameError` by ensuring the helper is defined before it is invoked during module initialisation.
- Capture governance-mandated context, validation strategy, and follow-up items for the sentinel flush ordering fix.

### Context Review
- `git status` → clean working tree on branch `work`.
- `git log -n 10 --oneline` → reviewed recent sentinel/order-related commits for prior context.
- `git diff origin/main...HEAD` → still unavailable because no `origin` remote is configured inside the container; logged as an operational limitation.
- Re-read `AGENT.md`, `memory/codex_memory.json`, and `memory/logic_inbox.jsonl` to ensure alignment with verbose implementation and documentation policies.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps (Self-Prompt)
1. Inspect `ACAGi.py` where `flush_pending_sentinel_events()` is called to confirm current ordering and dependencies.
2. Decide between relocating the function definition or deferring the call; prefer minimal change that preserves dispatcher initialisation semantics.
3. Update documentation artifacts (`CHANGELOG.md`, session log) and durable memory if the ordering guarantees amount to a new repository lesson.
4. Run `python ACAGi.py` to validate import-time execution, acknowledging the expected `PySide6` limitation while verifying the sentinel flush no longer raises a `NameError`.

### Open Questions / Risks
- Confirm that no other module-level side-effects rely on the flush occurring immediately after dispatcher helpers are defined.
- Ensure governance artefacts remain in sync if additional ordering constraints emerge from testing.

### Pending Inbox Items Impact
- No pending inbox tasks are resolved by this change; sentinel policy enforcement tests remain future work.

### Proposed Validation
- `python ACAGi.py`
- `python -m py_compile ACAGi.py`
