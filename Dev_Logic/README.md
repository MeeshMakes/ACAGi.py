# Dev Logic Workspace

This directory houses active design explorations, verbose decision logs, and prototype runbooks. Each note must begin with a self-authored writing prompt that explains the problem space, the investigative approach, and validation metrics. Once a logic document is finalized, move it into `Implemented_logic/` with a semantic version tag in the filename.
