Codex-Local – Comprehensive Program Design & Architecture Document
Vision and Overview

Codex-Local is envisioned as a powerful, fully local AI coding assistant and development environment. It combines a virtual desktop UI with intelligent agents (like Codex for code and other LLMs for chat) to help build and modify software autonomously. The system operates 100% locally – no external API calls are required for core features – giving it full access to the filesystem and tools without network dependence. Our goal is a self-contained workstation where natural language, code, and multimedia (images, voice) all converge to streamline development tasks.

Current State vs. Goal: Right now, the Codex Terminal script (previously simple_codex_terminal.py) is the only fully working piece – it reliably sends user prompts to a local Codex model (via a CMD shell bridge) and returns code or text outputs to a GUI terminal view. We will preserve and build upon this stable core. Around it, we’ll integrate a Windows-like Virtual Desktop interface, advanced Editor windows with AI assistants, a custom semantic memory (RAG) system, and multi-modal capabilities like image recognition (OCR/vision) and potentially voice. All these components will be orchestrated with careful logging, versioning, and user controls, making Codex-Local a robust autonomous development agent.

Key Objectives:

Maintain the existing Codex Terminal workflow (no regressions in how we send commands or get responses).

Expand capabilities with minimal intrusion – new features (vision, memory, etc.) should slot in without breaking the UX.

Use a high-contrast, modern UI theme throughout (inspired by Windows 10+ aesthetics) for consistency and readability.

Treat all AI subsystems as “operators” in a coordinated team, each with clear roles, sharable knowledge base, and configurable settings.

Ensure all operations are local-first and auditable: the user should be able to inspect logs, see what the AI is doing, and have final control over critical actions.

Core Design Principles (Non-Negotiables)

Local Execution & Full Access: The AI agents (Codex and others) run on the user’s machine with unrestricted file system access. They can read/write files, run commands, etc., without constantly asking for permission (unless a safety rule is triggered). A settings toggle will exist for “approval-free operation,” defaulting to on for power users who trust the agent.

Stability of Codex Bridge: The Codex Terminal’s communication loop (user input → send to shell → Codex model → output captured → display in GUI) must remain rock-solid. We do not alter the fundamental I/O logic that is currently working. All new features must be added around or on top of this loop without breaking it. For example, when adding image or voice input, it should eventually translate into text commands to Codex in a way that doesn’t disrupt the flow.

No Focus Stealing / Non-intrusive UI: Automation actions (like sending the “Enter” key to the shell or opening windows) should never steal focus from the user. The Virtual Desktop will manage windows internally so that, for instance, sending a command to the embedded CMD happens in the background (using the process handle) with no flicker or forced focus on that window. The user should always feel in control of the interface.

High-Contrast Modern Theme: The interface uses dark backgrounds with light text (or vice versa in specific widgets) to ensure readability. Every state (active window, inactive window, disabled controls, error messages) must meet contrast standards. The Virtual Desktop currently implements a blue-accented Windows-like theme – we will continue with that, ensuring any new UI elements (chat panels, editor highlights, error console) follow the same palette and style guidelines for a cohesive look.

Append-Only and Auditable: Key logs and memory files are never arbitrarily overwritten or cleared; instead, we append to them or version them. This includes conversation history, agent decisions, and error logs. For example, we will maintain an Agent.md session log for autonomous agent actions and a CHANGELOG.md (or similar) for tracking major changes. This principle ensures there is an audit trail for debugging and trust.

Modularity & Extensibility: New features should integrate via well-defined interfaces. We prefer modular classes or components (Terminal card, Editor card, Vision module, etc.) over one monolithic script. This not only aligns with good code structure but also makes it possible to enable/disable certain features (e.g. vision processing or voice) without affecting the rest. Each module can be developed and tested in isolation (e.g., we can unit test the OCR pipeline, or run the Virtual Desktop headlessly to verify it initializes the environment correctly).

System Architecture Overview

Codex-Local consists of several cooperating components:

Virtual Desktop Environment: A Qt-based desktop UI (Virtual_Desktop.py) that acts as a container for various tool “cards” (windows) – Terminal, Editor, Explorer, etc. It replicates key behaviors of an OS desktop (taskbar, icons, draggable windows) but in a controlled environment where AI agents can manage content.

Codex Terminal Module: An interactive shell + AI coding assistant, running as a card or standalone window. It bridges user natural language commands with code execution through a local Codex model. The Terminal handles text I/O with the shell (CMD by default) and uses an embedded conversation history to give Codex context.

Editor Cards with AI Assistant: Advanced text/code editor windows that include a side panel for chatting with an AI about the open document. These allow the user to develop code or write content with inline AI support. Each Editor card manages its own file content, syntax highlights, an error console, and a mini chat history specific to that file.

Agent Operators and Manager: The collection of AI “operators” running in the system – e.g., the Codex code agent, a conversational LLM for general dialogue, a potential voice agent, etc. – will be tracked by an Operator Manager. This might be a panel or internal registry where each agent’s status, current task, and settings are listed. The Operator Manager ensures that these different AI components can coordinate (sharing context when appropriate) and that the user can inspect each one’s role.

Memory & Dataset System: A local semantic memory store that records conversations and significant data for long-term usage. This includes markdown transcripts of interactions (for human-readable logs) and a parallel vector database of embeddings for semantic search (for machine-readable recall). The system also indexes its own codebase and docs into a dataset, effectively creating a knowledge base the AI can query about its own implementation (a “living” documentation).

Multi-Modal I/O Modules: Additional modules for handling images and audio. The image module provides OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and vision-language analysis so the AI can interpret screenshots or diagrams. The audio module (future integration) would handle speech-to-text (for voice commands) and text-to-speech (reading responses aloud). These modules feed into the main agents: e.g., voice input would be converted to text and sent to the Terminal or Editor chat, while an image dropped into a chat triggers the OCR+vision pipeline.

Autonomy and Workflow Orchestration: Higher-level logic that allows Codex-Local to operate autonomously on larger tasks. For instance, given a complex instruction, the system could break it into sub-tasks, use the appropriate agent for each (one for shell commands, one for editing code, etc.), and maintain a global view of progress. This includes safety checks and fallbacks – e.g., the system might plan changes to multiple files but only execute them after reviewing or testing, to avoid cascading errors.

Logging and Debugging Tools: Cross-cutting components that log agent activities and system events. A dedicated Error Console card will capture exceptions or shell errors in real-time, displaying them with a red theme to alert the user. Persistent log files (like system.log, ErrorDump.md, or dataset JSONL files) will also be maintained for post-mortem analysis.

Below, we break down these components and their features in detail, incorporating as much of the discussed logic as possible.

Virtual Desktop Environment

The Virtual Desktop is the canvas on which all other components run. It’s essentially a window manager and simulated desktop combined:

Desktop UI & Icons: The desktop background uses a Windows-like aesthetic – for instance, a blue gradient with an inner glow on the edges (already implemented). Icons on the desktop correspond to actual files or folders in a designated directory (e.g., ./Virtual_Desktop on disk). The system monitors this directory, so if a file is added or removed (either by the AI, user, or external means), the desktop icons update in real time. Icons can be dragged around to rearrange them, and their positions persist between sessions (stored in vd_state.json along with other UI state like window geometries). Drag-and-drop between the virtual desktop and the real OS is supported: dragging a file out will copy it to the real desktop or target folder, and dragging a file from the host OS onto the virtual desktop imports it into the environment. This fluid exchange ensures the user isn’t locked into a sandbox – they can bring in code, data, or images to feed to the AI easily, and likewise extract results.

Taskbar and Start Menu: Along the bottom of the virtual desktop is a taskbar, much like Windows. It contains:

A Start menu (possibly branded with a Codex-Local icon) which could house shortcuts to open core modules (e.g., “Open Codex Terminal”, “New Editor”, “Settings”, etc.), and a list of recently used files or sessions.

Running window buttons: Every open card (Terminal, Editor, etc.) appears as a button on the taskbar, so the user can minimize/maximize or bring windows to front by clicking these. This helps manage multiple open cards just like a normal OS.

System tray or menu: A section for system controls – e.g., a clock display, and possibly icons for background services (like if voice input is active, a mic icon; if internet access status, etc.). A “System” menu could provide options like “Settings”, “Exit”, and information about resource usage.

Opening Files and Apps: The desktop can open items in two ways: embedded or as subprocesses. For known file types, we embed custom viewer/editor cards:

Double-clicking a folder icon opens a Folder Explorer card confined to the virtual desktop, allowing basic file browsing within that directory (with the same drag-drop and context menu support for copy/paste, etc.).

Double-clicking a text file (.txt, .md, .json, logs, etc.) opens a Text Viewer card – a simple read-only viewer (with copy ability) for quick reading. (We also plan an Editor card for editing capabilities – see the Editor section – but a lightweight viewer is useful for quickly checking file contents without spawning a full editor with AI).

Double-clicking an image (.png, .jpg, etc.) opens an Image Viewer card. This is essentially a window with a scrollable image widget to view the picture. The Image Viewer may offer basic zoom controls. Notably, if this image was originally dropped into a chat for analysis, the viewer gives the user a chance to see it in full resolution (since our chat will often show a thumbnail or scaled version for performance).

Double-clicking a Python file (.py) attempts to embed it as a card. This means if the Python script is one of our modules (exposing a build_widget(parent) or create_card(parent, embedded=True) function), the Virtual Desktop will instantiate that UI component within a new card window. For example, launching Codex_Terminal.py from the Modules menu or via its icon will embed the Codex Terminal interface inside the desktop as a card (instead of a separate OS window). This embedding passes an environment variable CODEX_EMBEDDED=1 so the script knows it’s running inside the virtual desktop and can adjust its behavior if needed (e.g., not creating its own window frame). If a Python file doesn’t support embedding (like a random script), then the system will run it as a subprocess and capture its stdout/stderr into a Process Console card (a generic output console). This way, even arbitrary scripts can be run and monitored in the environment.

Executable binaries or unknown file types are also run as subprocesses with output captured to a console card. This ensures potentially dangerous or verbose programs don’t spawn uncontrolled OS windows or logs; everything stays encapsulated in our UI.

Module Launcher: In addition to clicking icons, a user (or agent) can launch core modules via the Start menu > Modules. For instance, “Open Codex Terminal” will find the Codex_Terminal.py script (likely in the same directory as Virtual_Desktop.py or a known path) and launch it embedded. Similarly, we might have shortcuts for “New Editor” (which creates a new Editor card, starting with a blank file), “Open Chat Agent” (if we have a standalone chat UI), etc. This centralizes how the user invokes different parts of the system.

UI Theme Integration: All cards (Terminal, Editor, etc.) should adopt the Virtual Desktop’s theme constants. The Virtual_Desktop script defines a Theme dataclass with colors for backgrounds, text, borders, etc. When we create new UI widgets (like the chat panel or the notes section in an Editor), we will apply these theme colors for consistency. For example, cards have a dark background (card_bg = "#0c1320") with a slightly lighter header bar (header_bg = "#0a111e" and text header_fg = "#eaf2ff"). We’ll ensure the Editor text area uses editor_bg and editor_fg colors, selection highlights, etc., all matching these definitions.

State Persistence: Beyond just remembering icon positions, the Virtual Desktop vd_state.json will store open windows and their geometry (so it can optionally restore your last workspace), recent items for quick access, and other user preferences (could be expanded to store whether the user had voice mode on, or which model was selected last in an editor, etc.). Persisting state provides continuity between sessions – a key to long-term memory outside of the AI’s own memory.

Current Development Focus: The Virtual Desktop is mostly in place, but for now we are not modifying it heavily while we focus on the Codex Terminal and related logic. It’s been moved into a concepts/ folder to indicate we’ll circle back. The plan is to integrate the Terminal and Editor enhancements into this desktop smoothly once they’re ready. We must ensure that running the Terminal standalone (outside Virtual Desktop) still works for headless or minimalist use, but the full experience will be inside the Virtual Desktop.

Planned Enhancements for Virtual Desktop:

Implement a Settings dialog accessible from the taskbar’s system menu or Start menu. This will allow toggling of various global settings (theme override, default models, autonomy level, etc.) in a user-friendly way. Settings changes should propagate to relevant modules (for example, turning off “Vision OCR” globally would cause the Terminal or Editor to skip OCR processing on images).

If not already present, add a clipboard integration: the user should be able to copy from real OS and paste into the virtual desktop (for bringing in code or text), and vice versa. This might require handling QClipboard events carefully.

Integrate an internal messaging/event system for the desktop. For instance, if an Editor card needs to notify the Terminal card about a file change or if the Codex Terminal wants to open a file in an Editor, it could send an event. Rather than hard-coding links, a publish/subscribe or direct method call via the desktop main window can coordinate these interactions.

Performance: Ensure that even if many cards are open (Terminal, multiple Editors, image viewers), the UI remains responsive. This might involve capping the frame rate of certain dynamic elements or unloading cards that are minimized for a long time (to free memory). As more heavy AI components are integrated (vision, large models), consider offloading them to background threads or processes to keep the UI thread snappy.

Codex Terminal Module

The Codex Terminal is the heart of the coding assistant behavior. It provides a conversational interface on top of a real shell. Key aspects and improvements:

Terminal + Shell Bridge: Under the hood, the terminal runs a persistent shell process (Windows CMD by default, since we’re on Windows environment for now). When the user enters input (which could be a command or a question/instruction for Codex), the system sends it to the shell. Non-blocking I/O is crucial: we write to the shell’s stdin and ensure a newline (simulating the Enter key) without stalling the GUI. The current implementation uses the subprocess module to spawn CMD and some thread or async loop to read its output. We will keep this mechanism, making sure that writing to the subprocess does not require the window to be focused (we target the process file descriptor directly).

Codex Model Integration: The shell launched by the terminal is likely augmented by Codex in the background. In an earlier iteration (in the Agent-Terminal project), launching the Codex agent involved writing a .codex_handshake.json with configuration and connecting to a local model server (like Ollama running a GPT model tuned for code). For Codex-Local, we will also ensure the Codex model (or any code-centric LLM like Code Llama, etc.) is running locally and accessible. The Terminal might invoke it implicitly: for instance, user text that is not a direct shell command is treated as a prompt for Codex. Codex then generates some code or command, which the terminal executes. Alternatively, if Codex runs continuously, it could intercept the input and decide whether to act (like a command parser). We need to clarify the loop: possibly natural language → Codex translates to shell commands → shell executes. This is akin to a “language-to-code” pipeline mentioned in the earlier design.

Example: The user types “Create a new Python file that prints Hello World.” The Terminal intercepts this, sees it’s not a valid shell command on its own, so it asks Codex (with context) how to fulfill it. Codex might return a JSON or direct shell commands to create a file and write contents. The Terminal then runs those commands (or uses an Editor to create the file). This dual nature – direct shell command vs. instruction – should be seamless. We’ll likely use a prefix or detection mechanism (maybe if the input line is in plain English or starts with a special token) to route to Codex’s interpretation pipeline.

Maintaining Conversation Context: Because Codex (and similar models) do not remember previous interactions by themselves, we maintain conversation.md as a rolling log of the dialogue between user and Codex within the Terminal. Every user query/instruction and every Codex response gets appended to this markdown file. We chose Markdown so that we can include rich content (formatted text, code blocks, images via ![](path) references, etc.). This file essentially serves as Codex’s memory for the current session. We cap the context that we feed into the Codex model to the last N interactions (configurable, currently ~25 pairs). That means when Codex is generating a new answer or code, it only sees the most recent 25 entries from conversation.md (to avoid token limits issues). We might implement auto context length: e.g., use as much context as the model allows (like if using a 16k token model, maybe include more history) or dynamically include earlier relevant parts by searching the conversation (like via embeddings). But by default, we have a fixed window for reliability.

Why not semantic tags in markdown: We considered tagging the markdown with semantic labels (for easier search or to mark important points), but decided against embedding such tags directly because it would clutter the visible chat transcript. The solution is to keep the markdown purely conversational and handle semantics in parallel (see the memory system below). Thus, the markdown remains human-friendly, and any metadata for machine use (like vectors, tags, references to internal files) will live in JSON or sidecar data structures.

Codex Agent Files (Prompts): Codex can be guided by “agent files” or prompt templates. These are separate files that contain system or developer instructions for Codex about how to behave, what its tools are, etc. The user mentioned that currently these agent files are mostly empty (no strong directives given, which might be why Codex sometimes underperforms or asks for approvals). We plan to fill these with useful content. For example, an agent file might state: “You are a local coding assistant with full system access. Do not ask for permission to write files or run commands; assume user has granted it. Always format your responses in markdown. Use the conversation history and local knowledge base to avoid repeating work. If you are unsure, you can search the datasets/ for relevant info. You have tools for shell commands, code editing, and more.” – basically setting the ground rules and available actions. We will maintain separate agent prompt files for different contexts if needed (one for Terminal, one for Editor assistant, etc., since the style and goals differ). These files will be loaded into the Codex’s prompt every time it runs (ensuring consistency in behavior).

Self-Updating Agents: A futuristic idea is allowing Codex to update its own prompt files as it learns. For instance, if the system notices a pattern of the user correcting the AI’s behavior or preferences, Codex could append a note to its agent file like “(Lesson: do not use tabs in code, user prefers spaces)” so it remembers next time. This would make the agent files a living persona memory. We will likely implement this cautiously: perhaps Codex can propose changes to its instructions, but require user review before applying them (to avoid corrupting its own directives). In any case, the architecture will support reloading these files or merging them with conversation context so the agent can evolve.

Multi-Shell Support: Right now, the Terminal uses a single shell (Windows CMD). However, users might want to utilize PowerShell or WSL (Linux subsystem) or even a Python REPL as the backend. We will design a Shell Adapter interface for the Terminal. This interface will abstract sending a command and reading output, so it doesn’t matter which shell or process is underneath. Then we can implement concrete adapters: CmdAdapter, PowerShellAdapter, WslAdapter, etc. The Terminal settings UI can offer a choice of shell if multiple are available. By default, we stick to CMD on Windows for stability. The other adapters will be present but disabled by default or hidden behind an “experimental features” toggle until thoroughly tested. The idea is that eventually the user (or AI) could switch shells depending on the task (e.g., use Bash/WSL for Linux-specific commands in a project, or use PowerShell for certain scripts).

We will detect availability: e.g., for WSL, check if wsl.exe is present and a Linux distro is installed; for PowerShell, it’s typically present on modern Windows anyway. The shell hooks would be mostly in the background – we won’t surface them prominently yet, to avoid confusing users. But the architecture will allow codex to target a specific shell if needed (maybe via a special command like /shell:PowerShell).

Note: Even when multiple shells exist, only one is active per Terminal instance. If a user wants to run two different shells concurrently, they could open two Terminal cards (each with its own adapter). The Virtual Desktop could allow “Open New Terminal (PowerShell)” etc., as separate icons or menu items in the future.

“Press Enter” Automation: A subtle but important feature is how the Terminal sends the actual “Enter” key to run commands. We want this to happen programmatically in the background. Currently, the working script likely already handles it, but we will double-check that it writes a newline to the subprocess without focusing it. We will improve this by perhaps using OS-specific calls or Qt signals to ensure the input is sent reliably. The user should never have to manually click into the (virtual) console and press Enter when an AI-generated command appears – the system should do it once the command is ready. But it must only do so at the right time, and not when the user is still typing or if the command is incomplete. We will add checks like: if Codex suggests a multi-line command or block of code, we might wait for a confirmation or a delimiter before executing. For example, if Codex writes out a script in the terminal, it might not be meant to run line-by-line immediately. This is an area requiring careful design to interpret Codex outputs correctly (maybe using markers or asking Codex to provide an “execution plan” JSON instead of raw commands in complex cases).

Output Rendering: The Terminal card will display output from both the shell and Codex. We use a monospaced font for the console area. Any text from the Codex that is a code block or markdown will be rendered appropriately (the console could actually be a rich text widget that understands markdown, or we pre-format it). If Codex outputs a markdown image link (e.g., an image result from vision), the Terminal should show the image inline. We might leverage Qt’s ability to handle <img> tags in rich text, or simply detect our special syntax ![]() and replace it with an image widget in the flow. Ensuring the console scrolls properly and doesn’t hang on huge outputs is also important (we might cap the number of lines retained, or for very large outputs, write them to a file and just indicate “[output too large, see file]”).

Integration with Virtual Desktop: When running inside the Virtual Desktop, the Terminal appears as a floating card window. When run standalone (just executing Codex_Terminal.py directly), it should open in its own window (for headless or direct usage). We’ll maintain both modes. Inside the Virtual Desktop, the Terminal will interact with other components – for example, if the user drags a file from the desktop onto the Terminal card, we could treat that as an input (maybe inserting the file’s path or content into the prompt). Conversely, Codex might generate a file and we want to show it on the desktop (we can then create an icon for it). These kinds of interactions are mediated by the Virtual Desktop’s event system. In design, we’ll keep the Terminal decoupled (it doesn’t need to know how the desktop does drag-drop, it will just expose hooks like on_file_dropped(path) that the desktop calls).

Future Shell/Terminal Features:

Command Palette & Macros: We can incorporate a command palette (like the Ctrl+Shift+P menu in VSCode) to quickly invoke internal commands or switch modes. Also, a macro recording feature (record a sequence of shell commands or AI actions and save it) might be useful. These were hinted in the Agent-Terminal summary (which had a Macro manager). While not top priority, our design keeps space for these: e.g., the Terminal could have a small “Macros” button or menu that lists saved macros and a “record new macro” function.

Speech Integration: In the future, the Terminal could support speech input/output. The user could speak a command, which gets transcribed (STT) and then processed as if typed. Similarly, the system’s TTS could read out responses or notifications. We have an AI TTS Agent reference which likely covers setting up a voice loop. When we integrate that, the Terminal might have a microphone icon to start/stop listening. However, since this adds complexity and wasn’t deeply discussed in the monologue beyond referencing the doc, we note it as a planned enhancement once core logic is stable.

Summary: The Codex Terminal remains the primary interface for interactive use, so it must remain rock-solid. All new logic (image handling, autonomy, etc.) will be integrated such that if something fails, it fails gracefully within the Terminal (e.g., an error will print to the Error Console, but the Terminal session continues unaffected). We will implement rigorous tests: for example, a headless test that launches the Terminal, sends a simple prompt (“2+2”), and verifies that the output “4” is captured in the conversation log, then exits. This ensures the basic loop always works after any changes. Only once this passes will we consider adding more fancy features on top.

Editor Cards with Integrated AI Assistant

One of the most powerful additions to Codex-Local will be the Editor Card, which allows for direct code or document editing with live AI guidance. This effectively brings the ChatGPT-style assistance into a development environment analogous to an IDE.

Editor Card UI Layout:

Main Editor Pane (Right Side): This is a text editor area with line numbers, syntax highlighting (if editing code), and basic editing features (undo/redo, find, etc.). We can utilize a QTextEdit or QPlainTextEdit in Qt for this, extended with code-friendly features. The line numbers might be implemented as a custom widget on the left margin of the text area. We’ll aim to support common file types like Python, Markdown, JSON out of the box with proper highlighting (possibly via QSyntaxHighlighter). If the file is a known programming language, we can also integrate linting or parsing to catch errors – for example, for Python, run a quick py_compile when saving to show syntax errors; for JSON, attempt a json.loads to validate format, etc. Any errors or warnings can be indicated by highlights in this pane and mirrored in the Console pane.

AI Chat Pane (Left Side): A sidebar panel where the user can converse with an AI about the document. This looks like a mini chat window (similar to the Terminal, but specific to the open file). It shows a history of messages: both user questions/commands (e.g., “Explain this function” or “Optimize this query”) and the assistant’s responses. The assistant model used here could be different from Codex; it might be a more general LLM (for explanation or discussion), or we could allow the user to choose (maybe GPT-4 for high-level discussion vs. a smaller model for quick help). We will include a model selector dropdown at the top of this chat pane, so the user can switch the AI operator (e.g., between a “Chat” model and “Codex” model). The reason to allow switching: sometimes the user might want a creative natural language answer (for documentation or brainstorming), other times a very strict coding suggestion. Different models excel at different tasks.

The chat pane will have an input box at the bottom (where the user types questions or instructions) and a send button. Hitting Enter will send the query to the assistant. The conversation is stored in a markdown (or similar) log per editor (e.g., editor_history/<filename>_chat.md or directly in memory/dataset). We’ll integrate the same kind of conversation.md + semantic archive approach here as with the Terminal (meaning the Editor assistant can remember earlier parts of the discussion about the file).

Context for the Assistant: The assistant in the editor should have awareness of the file’s content. We will include the current file (or relevant sections) in its prompt context. To do this efficiently, if the file is large, we might include just the portion being discussed or the function under the cursor. We can also use retrieval: if the user asks about “optimize this function”, we find which function the cursor or selection is in and feed that. If the conversation references something from elsewhere in the file, we may fetch those lines as needed. This dynamic context assembly will make the editor assistant more effective.

Notes/Tasks Pane: Optionally, below the chat pane or as a tab in the chat pane, we will have a Notes section. This is like a scratchpad or pinned notes area where the user (or AI) can store important snippets from the conversation or from the file. For example, if during the chat the assistant comes up with a great plan or the user writes a ToDo list, they can send it to the Notes pane. The UI might have a button on each chat message like “📌 Pin to Notes” which copies that message (or a summarized version) into the notes area. The user can also free-form type in Notes to jot things down. The Notes pane for each editor would be saved (perhaps in an .md file alongside the file, e.g., if editing foo.py, notes could auto-save to foo.notes.md). The purpose is to collect all key insights or directives in one place, separate from the back-and-forth of chat.

We also plan to implement versioned notes or task tracking: each note or entry could have a checkbox or status (like “to do”, “done”). The user or AI can mark when a suggested change is completed. Over time, the agent could learn to consult these notes to avoid repeating suggestions or to follow the plan step by step.

Console/Output Pane (Bottom): At the bottom of the Editor card, there will be a console area which can display things like compiler/output logs, error messages, or diff previews. This is essentially a feedback area. For example, if the user runs the code (we might allow running a script from the editor), the stdout/stderr would appear here. Or if the user asks the assistant to modify the code, we might show a diff of what will change here for review. It’s similar to an IDE’s build/run console.

Diff & Apply Workflow: A critical feature for safe AI-assisted coding is to preview changes. When the assistant suggests edits to the code, instead of blindly applying them, we will generate a diff. The diff could be shown in the console pane or in a separate pop-up window. It will highlight lines to be added, removed, or changed. The user then has the choice to accept, reject, or partially accept the changes. If accepted, the editor will apply the changes to the code pane (and we might mark those lines somehow to indicate new content until saved). We can also let the AI directly apply changes if the user trusts it (especially for trivial changes or if working autonomously), but having the diff step greatly reduces risk of messing up code without noticing.

Implementing this means when the AI returns a suggestion, we need to know the original content vs. new content difference. We could either have the AI output a unified diff format (we can instruct it to do so), or compute the diff ourselves by comparing the text before and after. It might be easier to have the AI just give the new version of a function/file, and we do a diff with current file content. Python’s difflib or a library can help generate a nice diff.

If the diff is accepted, we also should log that event (e.g., in a editor_history log or even commit it to a local git repo if one is tracking this project). Having version control integration would be valuable: we could automatically create a local git commit for accepted AI changes with a message like “AI edit: Optimized foo() based on suggestion”. This way, there’s a history of changes that is separate from the agent’s own logs.

“Create Logic Doc” Feature: This innovative feature breaks down a large document or code file into smaller, understandable pieces with AI-generated explanations. When the user clicks a Create Logic Doc button (perhaps in the editor toolbar), the system will:

Segment the File: The file will be parsed or split into logical sections. For code, this means:

Top-level imports and constants.

Each class definition (with its methods as sub-sections).

Each top-level function.

Any main block or script logic outside functions.
For text documents (like an MD or txt), it could split by headings or paragraphs.

Generate Summaries/Explanations: For each segment, use an AI (likely a GPT-4-style model if available) to generate a summary or explanation. For code, it could describe what the function does, what its parameters are, potential pitfalls, etc. For a document, it could summarize the section’s main point. We might also extract any specific questions or uncertainties for further clarification (like “This function’s purpose is unclear” – that could be flagged).

Output Logic Docs: Each segment’s analysis is saved either as separate files (e.g., logic_docs/filename/section1.md, section2.md, …) or as one combined document with clear headings. A convenient approach is to create a temporary markdown document where each section of the code is quoted (perhaps as a code block or reference) followed by the AI’s commentary on it. This essentially produces a mini design document or annotated code.

UI for Browsing Sections: The Editor card can open a side pane (or utilize the existing chat/notes pane area) to list the sections. For example, a list might show “1. Imports and Globals”, “2. Class Foo – description”, “3. function bar() – does X”, etc. Clicking on one could scroll the main editor to that section of code, and/or open the generated description in a popup or overlay. We might allow the user to edit these descriptions or add their notes to them, turning it into living documentation.

Usage of Logic Docs: These generated explanations serve multiple purposes:

Understanding: The user can quickly navigate and understand unfamiliar code.

Reviewing AI suggestions: If the AI later attempts to modify something, it can refer to these logic docs to avoid misunderstanding the code’s intent.

Refinement: The user could feed a logic doc section back to the chat assistant to ask more questions (like “You said this function might be slow; how to improve it?”).

Agent development: In an autonomous scenario, the Codex agent itself could generate logic docs for a piece of code before attempting a large refactor, to ensure it “understands” the code structure. This is akin to the agent building an internal knowledge map before making changes.

Implementation-wise, generating these might be time-consuming for large files, so we’ll ensure this runs asynchronously (so as not to freeze the UI) and perhaps indicate progress (like a spinner or progress bar through sections). We should also cache the results – maybe store them in datasets/logic_docs/ – so if the file hasn’t changed, we don’t regenerate everything next time (unless user forces refresh).

Editor History & Dataset: Similar to the Terminal, each Editor card will maintain its conversation history and embed it in a dataset for semantic search. Specifically:

A markdown transcript of the chat (with the AI and user messages about the file) for easy reading/reference.

A JSONL or database where each interaction (and possibly key points from notes or logic docs) are vector-embedded. This allows the assistant to retrieve relevant past discussion when a topic comes up again. For example, “Earlier we discussed optimizing this; what was the conclusion?” – the agent can search its editor history vectors to find that conclusion and not repeat itself.

Edits to the code could also be logged in this dataset. Possibly each diff accepted could be stored as an entry with an embedding of the diff or commit message. This could help the agent learn from its modifications or revert if a change was bad.

The Agent-Terminal reference mentioned storing editor chat logs under datasets/editor_history/ – we will follow a similar approach, making sure to segregate by file or session so they don’t mix contexts improperly.

Running Code and Testing: The Editor should let the user run the code they’re editing (if it’s runnable, e.g., a Python script). We can provide a “Run” button (for scripts) or even a “Test” button if there are tests present (this could integrate with a project’s test suite via shell commands). When run, the output goes to the bottom Console pane. If an error occurs, we capture the stack trace and ideally hyperlink the error line to the editor (so clicking the error jumps to that file/line). This tight integration shortens the debug loop significantly. Additionally, the AI assistant could observe the output – for instance, if a test fails or an exception is thrown, the assistant can automatically analyze it and suggest a fix. This connects to the concept of autonomy: the agent can be authorized to, say, run tests after making changes and then correct its code if something failed (a classic edit-compile-fix cycle automated).

Coordination with Codex Terminal: The Editor AI and the Codex Terminal agent should share knowledge when appropriate. For example, if the user was debugging an issue in the Terminal, then opens the file in the Editor, the Editor’s assistant could be made aware of the conversation from the Terminal (perhaps via the global dataset or by explicitly importing relevant Q&A from the Terminal’s history). Conversely, if in the Editor the user decides to apply a code change, the Terminal (if it’s monitoring the project) might want to run a build or commit the change. We might implement a simple messaging: when an Editor saves a file, it could send a notice to the Terminal agent like “File X was changed.” If we have continuous integration or a watcher, the Terminal (or some background agent) could then run tests or update documentation. These interactions can grow complex, so initially we’ll probably rely on the user to trigger cross-actions (like the user themselves going to Terminal to run tests after editing). But the architecture will be prepared for more automation here.

Memory and Semantic Dataset System

To empower long-term reasoning and avoid forgetting information, Codex-Local implements a custom RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) memory system. This spans multiple files and data stores: conversation transcripts, vector embeddings, and knowledge indexes. Here’s how it works and the logic behind it:

Conversation Logs (Markdown transcripts): Every interactive session (Terminal chat, each Editor chat, etc.) is logged in a markdown file that serves as the immediate memory. For example, conversation.md for the Terminal, and perhaps editor_<filename>.md for an editor’s chat. These logs record the exact words exchanged (including code and images in markdown form) so a user can scroll up or review past sessions easily. They are also useful for debugging (“what exactly did I ask the AI to do?”) and for exporting a session.

Context Window: Because LLMs have a token limit, we can’t feed the entire log for long sessions. We use a sliding window of recent interactions (configurable size). We might also implement an adaptive context: for instance, if the conversation is on a consistent topic, older turns can be truncated or summarized; but if the topic shifts, maybe include the last occurrence of that topic from further back. This is a complex area; initially a fixed window (like 20-30 last messages) is simplest. Advanced approach: use the vector store to fetch relevant earlier bits to include dynamically.

Auto-Summarization: As the conversation log grows, we could automatically insert summaries for older parts. E.g., after 50 exchanges, have the AI generate a concise summary of the first 40 and replace them in the active context with “[Summary of earlier discussion: …]”. The full log remains saved in the markdown file for history, but the model sees the shorter summary to save token space. This prevents context from being lost entirely while staying within limits.

Semantic Vector Store (Custom RAG): In parallel to the markdown logs, every piece of information is embedded into a high-dimensional vector space using an embedding model. We may use different embedding models for different content:

For general text (user queries, explanations), a general-purpose embedding model (like Sentence-BERT or similar) can capture meaning.

For code snippets, a code-aware embedding model (like OpenAI’s code search embeddings or CodeBERT) might be better to capture structural similarity (so the agent can find a function by description).

For images, if needed, we can use a vision embedding (like CLIP) to represent images in the same space or a parallel one.
We’ll likely maintain separate indexes or identify entries by type in one index.

Practically, each time a conversation turn or a significant event happens, we create an entry in a JSONL file (or a small SQLite DB) with fields like: session_id, role (user/assistant/system), text (content or summary of content), maybe tags (manually assigned category or source, e.g., “error”, “code”, “design”), and the embedding vector. This file lives in datasets/ directory. For example, datasets/terminal_history.jsonl could accumulate the Terminal chat embeddings, and datasets/editor_history/filename.jsonl for each editor file, etc.

Retrieval API: We will implement a helper function (perhaps accessible to the AI agents as well) called retrieve(query, k) which takes a text query and returns the top k relevant pieces of information from the vector store. For instance, if Codex is about to answer a question, it could query something like “user question context” to find if the user has asked something similar before or if it has seen related data. Or if the user mentions a function name, it could retrieve where else that function was discussed. The retrieved snippets can then be fed into the prompt to give the model more knowledge (this is the augmentation part of RAG).

Semantic Tags & Weights: The user spoke about a “semantic basis” or initial knowledge. We might incorporate a predefined set of vectors for basic programming concepts or common knowledge, so the system has reference points. This could be as simple as embedding some official docs or a glossary of terms into the store at startup (so the AI can recall definitions, etc., if asked). Over time, the system’s own accumulated data will form its unique knowledge base – effectively a personalized model of the project and usage.

Each embedded entry could also carry a “usage weight” or count – essentially a “bean counter” as described. Each time a snippet from the dataset is actually retrieved and used in a prompt, we increment its usage count. This allows us to measure what information has been most useful. If some entries have zero hits after a long time, they might be irrelevant (or poorly embedded). If some are very high, those are critical facts that perhaps should be pinned in the agent’s prompt or summarized permanently somewhere. We can periodically analyze these weights to decide if we need to prune the dataset (remove redundant info) or re-embed things with a better model.

Long-Term Memory Datasets: Beyond session-specific logs, we will create specialized datasets for different knowledge domains:

System Knowledge Dataset: A semantic index of the Codex-Local system itself. This means indexing all our key source code files, documentation (like this design doc, README, etc.), and perhaps even commit history or design decisions. The idea is to give the AI agents awareness of the system they are operating in. For example, if the user asks “How does the Virtual Desktop handle image files?”, the AI could retrieve the relevant portion of this design or the code from Virtual_Desktop.py that deals with .png double-click logic, and then answer with specifics. To build this, we’ll have an offline process (or a startup routine) that goes through each file in the repository:

Skip irrelevant files (like large data or assets), focus on .py, .md, .txt, etc.

Break them into chunks (maybe by function or paragraph).

For each chunk, embed it and store with an identifier of the source (filename and location). Optionally, also store a summary of the chunk in plain text.

Save all these to datasets/system_index.jsonl.
The agent files (which provide prompting instructions) should definitely be included here because they tell the AI about the roles – ironically, the AI might use the index to recall its own instructions if needed.
This system index acts like a built-in Stack Overflow/documentation for the AI. When Codex is working on something and needs to know how another part of the system works, it can query this dataset. It’s like giving the AI a memory of reading the entire codebase without the context window cost.

Archived Sessions Dataset: Over time, as conversation.md grows too large or a session is concluded, we might move it to an archive (e.g., Archived Conversations/ folder) and start a fresh conversation.md. Those archives can also be indexed so that the AI doesn’t repeat past mistakes or can recall an approach tried earlier. The Agent-Terminal design suggested scanning archived conversations at startup to glean context – we can do similar: on launch, have an agent quickly summarize all archived logs to see if anything is relevant to today’s tasks (storing those insights in Agent.md maybe). This ensures continuity between sessions, giving a sense of long-term memory.

User Persona and Preferences: There might be a dataset for user-specific info – e.g., the user’s coding style preferences, environment details, or any personal notes. For instance, if the user always wants docstrings in a certain format, we add an entry “coding style -> uses Google style docstrings” to a profile dataset. The AI can retrieve this when formatting code. This addresses the “persona” aspect: the AI maintaining a memory of the user’s personality or specific instructions that persist across sessions (like "always use UK English", or "the user is averse to using global variables", etc.). We can have a simple user_prefs.json or incorporate it into the agent prompt as well.

Buckets and Chunking Strategy: The user described a concept of “bucketting” information – grouping related info into buckets which can be versioned and referenced. This is somewhat analogous to how we chunk and tag the data in the vector store. For example, all info about a certain bug fix could be a bucket, containing the conversation about it, the code patch, test results, etc. We don’t have a formal bucket structure yet, but we can simulate it by using tags or IDs in our dataset entries. For instance, tag everything related to “Feature X” with feature:X so we can retrieve all at once if needed. Versioning could mean if we have multiple iterations of similar content, we mark them v1, v2, etc., or simply timestamp everything (our JSONL will have timestamps anyway).

The bean counter usage count acts as a measure of importance/popularity of a bucket. We could periodically generate a report of “Top 10 most referenced topics in memory” which might be valuable for the developer to see (“Hmm, the AI is obsessed with ‘function foo’ perhaps I should clarify that in documentation.”).

We should also consider pruning or compressing rarely used data. If something has zero hits and is older than, say, 6 months, maybe archive it out of the active dataset to reduce noise. This can be manual or automated housekeeping.

Memory Control in UI: In the Settings UI, we’ll expose some controls for memory:

Option to clear the current conversation (start fresh) – which would archive the old one.

Option to flush or rebuild the semantic index (in case we updated a lot of code and want the index to reflect it).

Toggling retrieval augmentation on/off (some users might want pure model responses vs. model with RAG; also if something goes wrong with the retrieval we can turn it off).

A view or export of the conversation or notes.

A display of memory usage (how many past messages, how large the dataset is, maybe how many tokens or vectors stored).

Possibly a “forget” button to exclude certain past items if they are causing confusion (e.g., if the AI keeps referencing an outdated plan, the user can tell it to forget that).

In summary, the Memory & Dataset system ensures that Codex-Local agents have both short-term and long-term memory: short-term via context windows (recent markdown logs) and long-term via embedding-based recall of any piece of knowledge they’ve seen before or that we’ve pre-loaded (like documentation). This combination lets the system scale beyond the normal limitations of an LLM’s context size, as it grows with usage. It also provides a form of learning: the system, over time, builds up a repository of “experience” it can tap into when facing similar tasks, hopefully leading to better and faster solutions.

Image and Vision Pipeline (OCR & Visual Reasoning)

Codex-Local incorporates robust image handling so that screenshots, diagrams, or photos can be part of the development conversation. The plan is to support dropping images into any chat (Terminal or Editor) and having the system intelligently process them. Key components of the image pipeline:

Image Input Methods: The user can bring an image by drag-and-drop onto the chat window, by using an “attach image” button, or by pasting (Ctrl+V from clipboard if they screenshot something). The system will save the image to a file (e.g., in a conversation_media/ folder or a temp path) and then reference it in the conversation markdown like ![](path/to/image.png) so that it displays in the UI. At the moment of insertion, we’ll kick off processing in the background.

Dual-Pass OCR & Analysis: We employ a two-step AI process for images:

OCR Pass: Use an OCR engine to extract any text from the image, outputting it in a structured format (ideally Markdown). For example, if the image is a screenshot of code or an error message, the OCR might produce text with proper line breaks, maybe even markdown code fences for code sections. If the image is something like a UI screenshot, OCR might find button labels or headings. We could use a library like Tesseract or an offline model for this. The output of OCR is then included as a block in the chat under the image, labeled clearly as “OCR Extract (Markdown)” or similar. This way, both the user and the AI can see the text content of the image. The AI (Codex or Chat model) will have this text in the prompt for the next step.

Vision Model Pass: After OCR, we run a vision-language model that can interpret the image in context. We will feed it the image (pixel data) along with the OCR text (as additional context, perhaps prefixed as “The image contains the text: …”). This model could be something like LLaVA or BLIP-2, which are multimodal LLMs that accept images. The goal here is to get a higher-level understanding or description. For example, if the user dropped a screenshot of a compiler error, OCR gives the error text, and the vision model can parse the layout (maybe the error is highlighted in red, etc.) and provide a summary: “It looks like a screenshot from Visual Studio showing a compile error: ‘NullReferenceException’ at line 42.” Or if the image is a diagram, OCR might find no text, but the vision model can describe it: “It’s a class diagram with three classes: User, Account, Transaction, and arrows indicating relationships.” The output of this vision model will be inserted as another message in the chat, e.g., “Vision Analysis: … description …”.
This dual-pass approach ensures that any textual content is accurately captured (OCR excels at text) and the overall context or non-textual content is understood (vision model’s job). The markdown from OCR is also valuable for copy-pasting if needed.

Usage in Prompts: Once we have OCR text and a vision summary, how does the AI actually use it? Essentially, these get appended to the conversation history that Codex or the assistant model sees. So if the user’s last message was just an image, the AI’s next prompt context will contain something like: “User sent an image. OCR result: <text>; Vision analysis: <description>.” Then the AI can respond to the user’s implicit question about the image or proceed with whatever the user’s intention was (the user might say “What does this error mean?” while dropping the screenshot – the AI now has the error text to answer with).

Displaying Images in UI: In the chat UI, we will show the actual image (scaled down to fit nicely). Under it, we’ll show a collapsible section for “OCR text” (because raw OCR text can be long/noisy; maybe it’s hidden by default and the user can expand if interested). The “Vision Interpretation” text will appear as a normal assistant message describing the image. By citing both, the user can verify the extraction and the interpretation.

If the image is very large, we may initially display a scaled version or thumbnail. The user can double-click it to open the full Image Viewer card (as described in Virtual Desktop) to see details.

Thumbnail and Memory Optimization: High-resolution images are heavy in memory and storage. We implement a rule (the user called it a global rule for images beyond certain context depth): After 25 message pairs (or when an image scrolls out of the main context window), we replace its inline representation with a thumbnail.

Concretely, the original image might be saved as img_1234.png. We create a tiny thumbnail img_1234_thumb.png (say 100x100 pixels or whatever retains recognizability). In the conversation.md, we would replace the original image link with the thumbnail path (or an HTML <img> with width/height attributes). This is done only for messages that have slipped out of the active context window or when archiving conversation segments. The effect is that the on-screen chat history and the markdown file remain lightweight.

The original image file is still kept in storage (perhaps in an archive folder or with a reference link), so it’s not lost. We could even store a mapping in the dataset like: when the image was first processed, we keep an entry linking the image’s content to its summary (vectors, etc.). Then we can confidently remove the full image from immediate memory.

If at a later time the user or AI needs that image again (say the user scrolls way back or asks about it), we can retrieve it from disk. The UI could then dynamically reload the high-res version if needed. Or if the AI wants to re-run analysis (maybe with a better model or to double-check something), it can fetch the original image path via the dataset and do so.

Storing Image Data: We will extend the dataset to include image embeddings. For instance, after processing an image, we can take the vision model’s embedding or use a model like CLIP to get an image embedding vector. This goes into the vector store with the text summary as metadata. That way, if later the user asks “find that screenshot about NullReferenceException”, the system can vector-match the text “NullReferenceException” or even a rough description to the stored image entry, and possibly re-surface it. This is advanced usage but very helpful for long-running sessions with many images.

Also, the OCR text itself gets stored in the dataset as a text entry. So even without image matching, a keyword search for an error code could find the OCR text from that image.

Multi-Modal Outputs: Not only input, but the AI might output images too (for example, generating a graph or design diagram). While generating images is out of scope for now (unless we integrate something like stable diffusion later), the AI could reference an image by file path. If that happens, the Terminal or Editor should render it. We have to ensure any ![alt](file.png) in the assistant’s message triggers the UI to load that file (from the Virtual_Desktop folder or wherever it resides). Security-wise, since this is local, any path would be local. We might restrict it to within the project directory for sanity.

Error Handling: OCR can fail or produce garbage if image is unclear, and vision models might be uncertain. We should handle those gracefully. For instance, if OCR returns nothing meaningful, we just won’t show an OCR section (or show a message “(No text detected)”). If the vision model is unsure, it might say “I’m not sure what this image contains.” The system should catch if, say, the vision model times out or errors out (e.g., model server not running) – in which case we output a message in the chat like “Error: Vision analysis failed.” and perhaps advise the user to check settings or logs. That’s where our Error Console could pop in with details of, say, a missing model file or similar.

Performance Considerations: Running OCR and a vision model can be time-consuming (especially if using large models). We will run these in background threads or processes so the UI remains responsive. Possibly we spawn a separate worker for vision tasks. The user will see a placeholder “Processing image…” message while this happens. We might add a small spinner icon on the image thumbnail or next to the message indicating work in progress. Once done, we edit the placeholder to add the results. Qt allows updating message widgets after creation if we manage them properly.

We may also allow the user to cancel processing if it’s taking too long (like an “X” button on the placeholder).

Conclusion: The image pipeline ensures that Codex-Local can handle visual information, integrating it into the coding workflow. This is extremely useful when dealing with screenshots of error logs, whiteboard photos of architecture, UI mockups, etc. The combination of OCR and a vision-language model means the system gets both low-level and high-level understanding, which it can incorporate into its reasoning. Moreover, our approach to downscaling old images and storing their data helps manage memory so the system can handle many images over long sessions without bloating.

AI Operators and Agent Orchestration

Rather than a single monolithic AI, Codex-Local comprises multiple AI operators, each with distinct responsibilities and strengths. This section outlines these roles and how they work together, as well as the concept of an Operator Manager to oversee them.

Codex Agent (Code Operator): This is the core code-writing and editing AI, derived from OpenAI Codex or similar code-centric model. Its job is to take user instructions and produce code or shell commands. It is used in the Terminal and for applying direct code edits in the Editor. We configure Codex with high system-level permissions – it can create or modify files, run commands, etc., according to user guidance. In autonomous scenarios, the Codex agent can plan and execute multi-step coding tasks (like “Implement feature X”, which may involve editing multiple files and running tests). It is guided by agent prompt files tailored to coding tasks (as discussed, with instructions not to ask for permission and how to format output). We might have separate prompt modes for Codex:

Shell mode: when interpreting a natural language command to shell actions.

Edit mode: when making changes in a code file context.
These modes could even be separate “personalities” if needed, each with slight differences in prompting.

Chat/Conversation Agent (General Operator): This would be a more general large language model tuned for understanding and generating natural language (and possibly reasoning). Think of this as a ChatGPT-like assistant. Its role is to handle broader queries, explanations, or non-code tasks. For instance, in the Editor chat, when the user is discussing design or asking for an explanation, this agent may be invoked. It might also be used for things like summarizing text, brainstorming names, or giving high-level advice that’s not just code. This agent doesn’t execute commands directly; instead, it provides guidance or intermediate outputs (which Codex might then act on if needed). We ensure this model is good at following conversational context and has a large knowledge base (maybe an offline model like Llama2 70B or GPT4All, etc., depending on user’s hardware).

Voice Agent (Speech Operator): If we integrate the AI_TTS functionality, this operator would handle speech input and output. It isn’t an “LLM” generating new content from scratch, but rather an interface:

On input side, a Speech-to-Text (STT) module listens via microphone and converts speech to text. That text is then fed to either the Codex or Chat agent depending on context (e.g., if you’re focused in the Terminal, voice input goes to Terminal as if typed; if an Editor chat is open, it goes there).

On output side, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine can speak the assistant’s responses aloud. This is more of a UI/UX feature, but we consider it an agent because it needs to know when to speak (maybe not voice every single line of code, but speak summaries or confirmations). We might allow toggling voice feedback on/off per context.
The persona aspect might come in here: the voice agent could have a configurable voice (perhaps using Windows built-in voices or an offline TTS like Coqui or Azure if local). It adds an immersive dimension to using Codex-Local, especially for hands-free operation or accessibility.

Tool/Translator Agent: This is a conceptual operator that might handle the “language-to-command” translation in the Terminal. Possibly we can implement it as a prompt pattern or a small model that takes a user request and outputs a JSON of actions. For example, the user says “Open the project folder and search for TODOs,” this translator could output something like: {"action": "shell", "command": "grep -R 'TODO' ."}. In the Agent-Terminal design, there was mention of an l2c.generate tool and structured intents. We could incorporate that concept here: an intermediate layer that maps intents to commands, using either rules or an LLM prompt. If we treat it as an operator, it would be one that doesn’t interact directly with the user but is called by the Terminal agent.
This is advanced and might not be implemented immediately, but designing the system with this possibility means writing the Terminal logic in a way that’s not tied to one big model doing everything. Instead, it could consult this translator agent for help when needed (like a specialized skill).

Reviewer/Validator Agent: A future operator could be a code reviewer or test runner agent. For example, after Codex writes code, the Reviewer agent (which could be another instance of a code model or even a static analyzer tool) checks the changes for mistakes, style issues, or whether tests pass. It then provides feedback. In an autonomous loop, Codex could use this feedback to correct its output. This concept is often called “self-healing” or “critic” in AI workflows. We note it here to ensure our design can accommodate it. For now, the user can play the reviewer role (inspecting diffs and test results), but eventually an agent might automate that.

Operator Manager UI: To give the user insight and control over these various agents, we will implement an Operator Manager panel or menu. This would list each agent with some details:

Name (e.g., “Codex (Code Assistant)”, “ChatGPT (Conversationalist)”, “Voice Input”, etc.).

Status (idle, listening, busy generating, error, etc.).

Role/Description (“Writes code and executes commands”, “Answers general questions and explains”, “Awaiting voice input”, etc.).

Possibly a button to open their prompt or config, and another to restart/refresh them if something goes wrong. For example, if one agent crashes or gets stuck, the user could restart it from here.

Maybe usage stats like how many tokens each used, or how many times invoked, which might help the user optimize or detect runaway processes.
The Operator Manager could be a window accessible from the Start menu or a tray icon (like a small dashboard). It’s mostly for power users or debugging – typical users might not need to interact with it often, but it’s invaluable when fine-tuning the system or diagnosing issues (e.g., “Why is the voice agent not responding? Let me check the manager – oh it’s disabled or not started.”).

Inter-Agent Communication: The agents should work in concert. We’ll define clear interaction points:

The Chat agent can defer to the Codex agent when action is needed. For instance, in Editor chat, if the user says “Implement this change for me,” the chat agent might formulate a plan or directly invoke Codex to do it. Possibly this is done through a shared memory or by the chat agent outputting a special token like <TOCODE> followed by an instruction, which the system intercepts and routes to Codex.

Codex agent can ask the Chat agent for clarification or context if needed (though usually the user provides that).

Both Codex and Chat agents use the common memory stores, meaning information discovered by one (e.g., through the system index or a conversation) is available to the other via the dataset retrieval.

All agents will log significant actions to Agent.md (an append-only master log). For example, if Codex autonomously created a file or ran a command, a line goes to Agent.md: “Codex: Created file X based on user request.” If the Chat agent summarized something, maybe not needed in Agent.md since it’s in the conversation log. The idea is Agent.md keeps a high-level audit, especially of autonomous or critical actions, so one can review “what did the system do on its own?”.

Persona and Directive Management: We will maintain the prompt instructions for each agent in separate files (or sections of a config). For instance:

prompts/codex_system.txt for Codex agent system prompt.

prompts/chat_system.txt for Chat agent.

prompts/codex_shell.txt for Codex’s shell translator behavior, etc.
These can be loaded at runtime and even edited through the UI (maybe an advanced settings section to tweak them). This allows on-the-fly adjustments and experimentation without changing code. If the user finds the AI is not doing something right, they can adjust the persona or rules here and reboot the agent.
As mentioned, the Codex agent’s persona might evolve (self-updating). We will likely lock the base persona file and instead have an overlay file where the AI can write additions. Then each run, we combine them (so the base is always there, and new “lessons” appear after). If it goes awry, the user can clear that overlay or revert it.

Autonomy Workflow (“Full Autonomy” mode): In normal mode, the AI waits for user input and then responds (though it might suggest next actions). In a full autonomy mode, the AI could initiate actions by itself. For example, suppose the user gives a high-level goal or enables an auto-complete feature; Codex might generate a plan and start executing without further prompts. This is dangerous if unchecked, so we will likely implement it with a safety net:

The system might ask for a one-time confirmation: “Enable autonomous execution? The agent will make changes and run commands on your behalf.” Once granted, maybe it runs a while until it either finishes or hits a critical juncture (like it wants to delete a lot of files, at which point it could query user).

Autonomous loops: The Codex agent can have a loop where it checks its progress, reads new outputs (like test results), and decides what to do next. We can incorporate a reflection step where after a few actions, it stops and outputs a summary of what it did and plans to do, asking the user if it should continue. This ensures the user can intervene if it’s going off track.

Logging becomes even more important in this mode, since the user might be away while the agent works. The Agent.md log and perhaps desktop notifications (or even voice updates: “Agent: Completed step 1, moving to step 2…”) will keep the user informed.

Safety and Sandboxing: Even though we say full access, we do want to avoid catastrophic actions. So we will incorporate a Safety Layer (as also hinted in Agent-Terminal docs):

Certain keywords or actions (like rm -rf /, or formatting the C drive, or sending data to network) can trigger a safety check. This could be a simple regex list or a small classifier. If triggered, the system will pause and confirm with the user, even if in autonomy mode. For example, if Codex tries to delete a critical directory, we pop up “Safety Check: The agent is attempting to delete system files. Allow/Block?”. This is a last-resort brake to prevent irreversible harm.

We will maintain a list of protected files (the Agent.md itself, any config files, perhaps user-specified paths) that the agent should not modify unless explicitly allowed. The design doc snippet from Agent-Terminal listed some: Agent.md, memory files, etc., which should be append-only. We can use that as a guideline – e.g., if Codex tries to edit its own logs or this design doc, the system should prevent it or at least double-check.

This safety layer will be implemented as a function that scans each command Codex wants to execute, and each file write it wants to do (we can intercept at the point of execution). It’s not foolproof, but it adds some governance.

In essence, by having multiple specialized AI operators and a managing interface, we ensure Codex-Local is not a black-box but a transparent ensemble. Each part can be optimized for its task (coding, chatting, voicing, translating) and we can upgrade or debug them in isolation. The user ultimately has oversight via the Operator Manager and the Safety confirms. This architecture scales: new operators can be added, like a “Design Agent” that sketches UML diagrams or a “Data Agent” that handles datasets or queries. The system could orchestrate among them where a complex user request flows through multiple agents – all coordinated through the Virtual Desktop interface and shared memory.

Logging, Error Handling, and Debugging

A sophisticated system like Codex-Local needs equally robust logging and debugging support to track what’s happening, diagnose issues, and maintain trust with the user. We incorporate multiple layers of logging:

Conversation Logs: As described, all chats are logged in markdown files. These not only serve memory but are also a human-readable log of interaction. They should be timestamped (we can include timestamps in a subtle way, maybe HTML comments or in dataset, not necessarily cluttering the conversation view). If something odd happened, the user or developer can inspect the conversation to see if the AI was given a confusing instruction, etc.

Agent Action Log (Agent.md): We maintain an append-only master log of autonomous agent actions and significant events (like a diary of what the AI did beyond just talking). For example:

“2025-09-15 18:00:42 – Codex created file test.py and wrote 50 lines (added feature X).”

“2025-09-15 18:05:10 – Ran 3 tests, 2 passed, 1 failed (error…); planning fix.”

“2025-09-15 18:07:30 – Fixed bug in utils.py.”
This log (Agent.md or similar) is append-only to preserve history. It provides traceability for the agent’s autonomous operations and can be used to generate a summary report of what happened in a session. It’s also useful if the system has a crash or is restarted – it can read this log to remember where it left off.

System Log (system.log): We will use Python’s logging (as seen in Virtual_Desktop.py initialization) to log internal events, errors, and debug info to a flat file (system.log). This is more low-level, e.g., noting when a subprocess starts/stops, if a file watcher triggers, exceptions with stack traces, performance timings, etc. This file is mainly for developers of Codex-Local or advanced users if something goes wrong. It can be written with INFO level by default and DEBUG for more verbose.

Error Console Card: A special UI component dedicated to showing errors and warnings in real time. Whenever an exception occurs in the Python backend or an error message comes from a subprocess (shell errors, test failures, etc.), we capture it and route it to this Error Console. Visually, it’s a card with a red-themed header (to catch attention), and a scrollable text area listing error entries. Each entry might include a timestamp and a short description, possibly with a clickable expander to see full stack trace or error output. For example:

“[18:10:55] ERROR: Exception in OCR module – FileNotFoundError: tesseract.exe not found.”

Clicking that could expand to show the traceback if available.
The Error Console card could start hidden or minimized, and only pop up (or flash an icon on the taskbar) when a new error arrives. This way, if something fails silently in the background, the user is made aware. The card might have a button to copy the error details (for reporting issues or debugging) and one to clear the errors.
In implementing this, we’ll redirect sys.stderr and any unhandled exceptions to a handler that writes to both system.log and this UI. We might also integrate it with the logging module (like any log entry of level ERROR or CRITICAL triggers the console display).

Protected Files and Append-Only Enforcement: To align with the logging strategy, certain key files (Agent.md, conversation logs, etc.) will be protected from accidental writes. We can enforce at runtime that these are only opened in append mode, not write/truncate. If Codex tries to open Agent.md in write mode, we intercept and switch it or deny. Similarly, if the user manually opens these in an Editor, we might set them to read-only or at least warn not to edit history. This ensures the audit trail cannot be tampered with except by explicit user action.

Testing and Verification: We plan to include a suite of automated tests to catch regressions:

Headless UI tests: Using QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen to launch the application without rendering a GUI, we can simulate a few interactions. For example, start Virtual_Desktop, open Codex_Terminal in embedded mode, send a command, and verify a certain output or log file content. We want at least a basic smoke test as described earlier.

Prompt formatting tests: Ensure that images, code blocks, and other rich content from markdown are correctly translated to the model input (no broken syntax).

Resource usage tests: Possibly track that memory usage doesn’t balloon after many operations (for instance, simulate adding 100 images and ensure the thumbnailing strategy works to keep memory low).

Logic validation tests: If we formalize the translator agent (natural language to JSON commands), we can unit test that with known inputs.

These tests would be run locally, and perhaps integrated into a CI if this project is under version control, to ensure every commit doesn’t break core functionality.

Diagnostics Mode: For troubleshooting, we might add a mode (launch flag or setting) that increases verbosity and maybe logs all model prompts and responses verbosely to a file. This could help in understanding why the AI made a certain decision. Because normally, we only see what was displayed, but the actual prompt might have included hidden parts (like the agent instructions, or retrieved snippets). In diagnostics mode, we could dump the full prompt texts to a debug_prompt.log whenever a model is called. This is sensitive info, so it’d be off by default, but invaluable for development or if the user is fine-tuning the agent’s behavior.

Continuous Improvement:
Finally, we expect to refine this design iteratively. As new issues or needs come up, we’ll update this document (and CHANGELOG.md) accordingly. Key future investigations include:

Performance tuning for embedding lookups (if the dataset grows huge, consider using a vector database or sharding by date).

Possibly integrating a knowledge graph or more structured memory on top of the vectors, to capture relationships (the user hinted at semantic networks; we might not go fully there yet, but it’s in mind).

UI enhancements for better transparency, like hovering over an AI response could show which memory items it retrieved to craft that answer (“traceability of answers”).

More fine-grained controls for the user to erase certain memory (GDPR style: “forget my last query” or remove something from the dataset).

Multi-user or remote access scenarios (far future, if one wants to share their AI agent or allow pair programming with someone through it – not in scope now but architecturally not impossible).

In conclusion, thorough logging and error handling are not just for developers of Codex-Local but also form part of the user experience – by giving users insight into the AI’s operations and confidence that they can track and undo things. It builds trust: users will see that the system is doing only what’s recorded and nothing hidden. And for us building it, it provides the feedback loop to quickly catch and fix any issues that arise as we implement this ambitious feature set.

Future Extensions and Roadmap

(This section touches on additional ideas that have been mentioned or are inspired by the provided information, which may be slated for later implementation once the foundation above is solid.)

Integration with External Tools: Even though Codex-Local is offline-focused, there may be optional integration with external APIs if the user configures it. For instance, connecting to a GitHub repo to pull updates or create PRs, or using online libraries for more advanced speech synthesis. The system could have connectors that are disabled by default (keeping with local-first), but available for power users.

Project/Workspace Management: As users work on multiple projects, we may introduce a concept of workspaces. Each project directory can have its own dataset, config, and agent context. When you switch project, the agent’s memory and context switch accordingly. The Virtual Desktop could support multiple desktops or profiles for this purpose. This ensures the AI doesn’t mix information between unrelated projects (which could be a privacy issue or just cause confusion).

Enhanced Macro and Scripting System: Build on the macro idea to allow users (or the AI itself) to script repetitive tasks. Perhaps a Macro Recorder that captures a sequence of UI actions and AI commands, which can then be saved as a Python script or a high-level “workflow”. The agent could even generalize a recorded macro into a more flexible tool.

GUI Interaction by AI: Right now, the AI primarily interfaces through text (Terminal or Editor). In the future, the AI might control parts of the GUI directly (especially within the Virtual Desktop). For example, an agent could automatically open a file in an Editor card if it wants to make changes, or drag an icon to move a file as part of reorganizing the project structure. This would be a step toward agents that can use GUI applications (like how a human would). It’s complex but within a contained environment like ours, somewhat feasible. We’d have to expose an API or utilities for the AI to manipulate the Virtual Desktop (with safety checks to avoid chaotic behavior).

Collaboration and Multi-Agent Scenarios: The system could allow multiple AI agents or even other users to join a session. Perhaps one AI specialized in front-end, another in back-end, and they coordinate (with the user overseeing). Or a scenario where a remote collaborator connects to the Virtual Desktop UI over a network to pair program with the user’s AI. This is speculative, but our modular design of agents and clear delineation of roles sets the stage for orchestrating more than one at a time.

Learning and Adaptation: Over prolonged usage, Codex-Local could analyze its own performance. For instance, it might keep track of how often the user accepts its suggestions vs. modifies them, or which types of requests it struggled with. This meta-learning could inform adjustments to prompts or trigger fine-tuning of the local models (if the models are fine-tunable). Essentially, a closed-loop learning system: the more you use it, the more it tailors to your style and project specifics.

User Interface Polish: While function is priority, we won’t forget form. Some planned UI improvements:

Resizable and collapsible panels (so user can give the code pane more space, or hide chat if needed).

Themes: maybe a light theme option for those who prefer it (keeping contrast in mind).

Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (like Ctrl+Enter to send in chat, F5 to run, etc., customizable).

Visual indicators when AI is working (like a subtle glow or an animated icon on the card header).

Possibly a “wizard” mode or tutorial overlay to guide new users through the features, since this system will have a lot of functionality.

Documentation and Help: Ensure there’s an easily accessible help within the app – perhaps a “Help” card that can be opened from Start menu, containing a mini version of this design doc or a user guide. Also tooltips on buttons explaining their function. Given the complexity, good documentation will be key for adoption.

Detailed Implementation Tasks (Next Steps)

(For clarity, here is a breakdown of specific development tasks to implement the above features, roughly in priority order. Each task is described with what needs to be done and any important considerations.)

Rename and Initialize Codex Terminal:

Rename simple_codex_terminal.py to Codex_Terminal.py in the repository. Update any import or launch scripts accordingly (the Virtual Desktop module launcher should point to the new name).

Ensure backwards compatibility if needed: e.g., keep a stub simple_codex_terminal.py that imports everything from Codex_Terminal.py or prints a warning, just in case some external reference uses the old name.

Test that launching the terminal (standalone and via Virtual Desktop) still works exactly as before after renaming. No new features should be introduced in this step – it’s purely organizational.

Non-regression test: After renaming, run a quick scenario: open Terminal, send a known prompt (“Hello”), expect a Codex response (likely an error or greeting), and verify it appears properly. This ensures renaming didn’t break the handshake with the model or file paths (like conversation.md should still be found/created).

Codex Terminal Settings Pane:

Implement a settings section specific to Codex in the application’s settings UI. This should include:

Model selection (if multiple Codex-like models available, list them or allow entering a local model endpoint).

Toggle for “Autonomous write/execute” vs “Confirm before executing” (the default will be autonomous enabled, but user can require confirmations for each file write or command if they choose a safer mode).

Display of which agent files or prompt templates are in use for Codex (maybe just listing the filenames it loads, and a button to open them in an Editor for editing).

Possibly show current conversation length and a button to archive/reset it.

If feasible, a small indicator of memory usage by Codex (how many tokens used recently, etc. – though this might require model API support to get usage info).

Most settings are just toggles/values stored in a config (like in config.json). The Codex Terminal will read them (e.g., before executing a command, check the “confirm” setting). Some require wiring up UI events (like clicking “open prompt file” opens that file in an editor).

We also add a section for global AI settings (shared by all agents): e.g., default temperature or creativity setting for models, path to embedding models, and enabling/disabling certain operators (like turning off voice globally if not used).

Dual-Pass Image Processing Integration:

Choose and integrate an OCR library. If using Tesseract, ensure it’s installed or bundled. Alternatively, use a PyTorch OCR model if available offline. Write a function perform_ocr(image_path) -> markdown_text. Test it on a sample image with known text to fine-tune parameters (like language, DPI scaling).

Choose a vision-language model for analysis. Possibly run an open-source model like BLIP-2 or MiniGPT4 that can be called via an API or local pipeline. This might be heavy; ensure it’s an optional component (only load if user drops an image).

In Codex_Terminal (and Editor chat logic), add handling for image inputs: when an image is inserted, spawn threads to run OCR and vision analysis. Immediately show the image in the chat with a placeholder (“processing…”).

Once OCR is done, insert a collapsible text block. Once vision is done, insert the summary as an assistant message. Make sure these insertions are done in the correct order and thread-safe (probably use Qt signals to append to the chat from worker threads).

Implement the thumbnail generation and replacement. After the image is processed and some time passes (or when context window moves past it), programmatically replace the markdown in conversation.md from ![](full.png) to ![](thumb.png). Also update the chat UI element if it’s still visible (perhaps keep the full res in UI until it’s scrolled far offscreen).

Test with multiple images in one session to ensure the system doesn’t slow down. Check that original images remain accessible via viewer (like double-clicking the thumbnail opens the full image).

Edge cases: very large images (we might pre-resize them on load to a max dimension to avoid huge files); images with no text; vision model not available (should handle gracefully).

Semantic Memory Implementation (Datasets):

Decide on an embedding solution: possibly use an existing small model for embeddings (like all-MiniLM-L6 or similar for text) that we can run locally. For code, maybe the same or a specialized model if accessible. As a first pass, we could call an external API for embeddings if local is too complex, but that breaks offline principle – better to include a lightweight model.

Create a Python module for memory (e.g., memory_manager.py) that provides functions: log_interaction(session, role, content), embed_content(content), search_memory(query, session_filter=None, k=5). This module will handle appending to JSONL and keeping an in-memory index (maybe using faiss or just brute-force with numpy for now if small).

Whenever the Terminal or Editor adds to conversation.md (user or assistant message), call log_interaction which will:

Write the raw text to the JSONL (with session id or name).

Compute an embedding and store it (maybe in a parallel .npy file or in the JSONL as a list – though that makes the file big; better store vectors in a separate binary and keep references).

Implement retrieval: for now, a linear scan computing dot products to find top-k nearest. If performance suffers as data grows, integrate a vector index library.

Integrate retrieval into the agent workflow: before generating a response, the agent (especially the chat agent answering a question) could use search_memory with some keywords from the query to fetch relevant info. For coding tasks, maybe Codex can search the system index dataset for function names. This might be done implicitly by a smart prompt (like we give Codex a tool: “use [MEM] tag to recall memory” and it can output queries which we intercept, etc.), or more directly in code by fetching and injecting snippets into its context.

Build the system index creation process: likely a one-time script or a function that runs on startup (with a flag to skip if already done). Go through each file (we can maintain a list of file globs to include/exclude, possibly in config). Use the logic doc segmentation approach but for all files (maybe at the granularity of functions or classes for code, paragraphs for docs). For each segment, create an entry in datasets/system_index.jsonl with fields like source_file, section_name, content, and an embedding. Also maybe store a shorter description if possible.

Provide a way to update the index when the code changes: perhaps every time a file is saved in the Editor, we update that file’s entries in the index (remove old ones, add new ones). Or run an index refresh command manually when needed. At minimum, do an index rebuild if user explicitly chooses (in Settings or via a command).

Verify memory operations: test adding and searching manually. E.g., log some known text, then search for a keyword from it, see that it returns the logged text. Also test that conversations from different sessions don’t mix results unless intended.

Editor Card Implementation:
This is a big task, effectively creating a new UI module:

Create a new Python module/class, e.g., editor_card.py that defines an EditorCard (likely subclassing QWidget or a custom QMainWindow-like widget to embed).

Layout: use QSplitter and nested layouts. Perhaps a QHBoxLayout for main area splitting left (chat) and right (code editor), and a QVBoxLayout inside left for chat history and input, and another QVBoxLayout below code for console.

Start with basic functionality: open a file (pass file path to EditorCard, read content, put in a QPlainTextEdit). On close or periodically, save changes back to file. Syntax highlighting can be added via QSyntaxHighlighter – set that up for at least Python and JSON as a start (maybe borrow from existing examples or simple regex-based highlighter).

Implement line numbers: possibly a subclass of QPlainTextEdit to paint line numbers in the left margin. There are known patterns for this.

Implement the chat panel: likely a smaller text browser to show history and another QLineEdit or multi-line for input. The interactions here can reuse some logic from Codex Terminal (formatting messages, appending to view). Possibly abstract a “ChatInterface” that both Terminal and Editor chat use for consistency (so things like adding images or formatting code can be reused).

Hook up the model selection dropdown. For now, wire it so it affects which agent instance or API is used to generate responses. Could be as simple as storing a string like “chat” vs “codex” and in the send function, choose the corresponding prompt/policy.

The assistant responding: if using the same backend as Terminal, we might just call a function to get a completion. But likely, we’ll integrate with a model API (like if there’s an Ollama server for LLaMA, etc.). For initial testing, perhaps funnel it through the Codex model as well, but with a different prompt saying “act like a helpful explainer” to simulate a chat model. Later we can swap in an actual different model.

Implement the diff preview: when assistant suggests changes, compare text and show result. We might integrate a library for diff UI or do a simple text diff and show in console pane with +/- lines.

The notes panel: start with a simple QTextEdit for notes. Add a “Pin” button on chat messages (maybe each message in the UI can have a small icon if hovered – clicking it copies content to the notes QTextEdit with a separator or bullet).

The console: use a QPlainTextEdit (read-only) or QTextBrowser for rich text. Also consider how to show error messages or run outputs distinctly (maybe prefix lines with [RUN] or color them).

Testing: After building EditorCard, integrate it with Virtual Desktop: e.g., double-clicking a .py file now uses EditorCard instead of TextViewer. Or add a “New Editor” action in Modules menu that opens a blank EditorCard (prompt to choose file type to save as). Open two Editor cards to see if multi-instance works.

Memory integration: ensure each EditorCard when created makes a new entry in memory (like a session id maybe tied to file path) so its chat history logging goes to a separate file. Use the dataset functions to log these as well.

Ensure that editing a file updates the Virtual Desktop icons if needed (like if a new file created, Virtual Desktop should show it; probably already handles via watcher).

Polish: handle closing an Editor card (ask to save if unsaved changes), maybe a simple indicator for modified state (asterisk in title).

Implement “Logic Doc” generation:

Possibly reuse some of the summarization capabilities of the AI models we have. If we have a decent general LLM, we can prompt it with “Summarize the following function…” etc. Or for now, perhaps just plan out the segmentation part and use the same assistant model to summarize.

Write a function to split a given text (code or markdown) into sections. For code, we can do a quick parse: e.g., regex for def or class , etc., to find functions and classes. This won’t catch everything perfectly (nested classes, etc.) but as a heuristic it’s okay. Or use ast module for Python to get function names and docstrings (that could help identify segments boundaries).

Feed each segment to an LLM with a prompt like “Explain this section of code in detail, in markdown.” Get the responses.

Collate those responses into either one big markdown or multiple files.

Create a UI to display them: simplest is open a new Editor or Viewer with the combined markdown of explanations. But per earlier design, a panel listing each segment might be nicer. That could be implemented as a QListWidget on the side listing section titles; clicking one scrolls the main editor to that section (we can map by line numbers).

Possibly highlight the code segment in the editor when its summary is viewed (to visually connect explanation to code).

This feature can be heavy; maybe initial version is synchronous (locks UI) but we should ideally do it in background and show progress.

Testing on a medium file to see quality of summaries and adjust prompts if needed.

Operator Manager UI:

Create a simple dialog or widget that enumerates the operators. We can populate it with static info for now (Codex, Chat, Voice) and fill dynamic fields (like status) if we have them. Status could be tracked via signals (e.g., when an agent starts generating, set status “busy”).

Buttons: maybe “Restart” for each (which could reinitialize that agent’s state or reload prompt), and “View Prompt” which opens the agent’s system prompt file in a read-only viewer.

If voice agent is integrated, show a toggle for microphone on/off.

Make sure opening this manager doesn’t itself confuse the agents (we might avoid logging that as conversation).

Test by simulating an agent crash: e.g., kill the voice thread, see if manager updates or if the restart brings it back.

It’s okay if initially it’s basic; the presence of this panel itself is a win for transparency.

Voice Integration (optional, later):

Integrate an STT library (like VOSK or Coqui STT) to get live transcription. Could run in a thread listening from microphone. Connect to the Terminal or Editor input.

Integrate TTS (perhaps use pyttsx3 or an offline engine) to speak outputs. Possibly only speak assistant messages (not user inputs obviously).

Add UI elements: a mic toggle button on Terminal and Editor chat, and maybe an overall “mute” toggle. Also an indicator when the system is speaking or listening (like a small blinking dot).

This is a sizable feature on its own and requires careful threading (audio I/O can block). So, likely done after the main text-based logic is stable.

Testing and Refinement:

Rigorously test scenarios combining features. E.g., drop an image in Editor chat about code, ask it to fix code based on image content, see the flow.

Test autonomy mode: perhaps create a dummy function that intentionally has a bug and ask Codex to fix it autonomously, see if it runs tests and modifies code correctly.

Usability test: ensure that if a new user tries basic things (asking a question, editing a file, etc.), the system responds reasonably and UI elements are discoverable.

Performance test: open many cards, large file, etc., check memory and CPU. Optimize by lazy-loading things like the system index (maybe don’t load all vectors into RAM unless needed).

Documentation: update README and help to reflect new features. Summarize these changes in CHANGELOG as well.

Each of these tasks will be an iterative process, often overlapping (e.g., Editor development will run in parallel with memory logging). We should commit frequently with clear messages, respecting the append-only logs where applicable (for instance, we might append to CHANGELOG for each significant commit, as per the repo’s style).

By tackling the above, we will have transformed Codex-Local into a much more powerful system: one where you can chat with your code, have the AI suggest and apply changes, remember everything important, see and correct its actions, and even incorporate images and voice. It’s a large undertaking, but following this design document as a guide will help ensure we implement it systematically and thoughtfully, without losing sight of the core principle – keep the working pieces working, and build the new capabilities around them in a seamless manner.
