# Session 2025-09-26

## Objective
- Implement requested ExternalAppCard geometry cache adjustments per user instructions.

## Context Snippets
- external_app_card.py: ensure `_last_embedded_size` reset to `None` when containers change and treat cache as optional.

## Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Run targeted Qt embedding tests on Windows host when available to confirm geometry sync behavior.

## Work Log
- Refined ExternalAppCard embedding lifecycle to treat `_last_embedded_size` as optional, clear it when container widgets are created or destroyed, and persist successful geometry updates.
 - Gated ExternalAppCard geometry refreshes so synchronous updates reuse a cached HWND wrapper, trigger `UpdateWindow`, and only store `_last_embedded_size` when `_SWP_ASYNCWINDOWPOS` is not requested.
:::task-stub{title="Synchronize ExternalAppCard geometry updates with UpdateWindow gating"}
1. Open `external_app_card.py` in the repository root.
2. Inside `ExternalAppCard._sync_geometry`, assign `hwnd = wintypes.HWND(self._embedded_hwnd)` before invoking `_user32.SetWindowPos`.
3. After confirming `SetWindowPos` succeeds, guard the `_user32.UpdateWindow(hwnd)` call and the `_last_embedded_size` cache update with `if not (flags & _SWP_ASYNCWINDOWPOS)`.
4. Leave `_last_embedded_size` unchanged when `_SWP_ASYNCWINDOWPOS` is set so asynchronous operations can reconcile later.
5. Save the file and commit the change once validations are complete.
:::
:::task-stub{title="Refresh ExternalAppCard geometry cache handling"}
1. Edit `external_app_card.py` within the repository root.
2. In `ExternalAppCard.__init__`, annotate `_last_embedded_size` as `Optional[Tuple[int, int]]` and initialize it to `None`.
3. In `_embed_window` and `_release_window`, set `_last_embedded_size = None` immediately after calling `QWidget.createWindowContainer` and `deleteLater()` respectively.
4. Update `_sync_geometry` to compute `requested_size`, skip only when the cached size matches, and write back the new tuple after `SetWindowPos` succeeds.
5. Commit the changes and document them in session logs and memory records; use `/ask` for follow-up tasks or `/code` for code generation if needed.

## Additional Notes
- `git diff origin/main...HEAD` failed because the repository has no `origin` remote configured; fetched refs are unavailable in this environment.

## 2025-09-26 Follow-up
### Objective
- Align `test_external_app_card_sync_geometry_updates_during_drag` with the expected geometry sync call count after the drag cleanup completes.

### Key Snippet
- `tests/test_virtual_desktop_external_launch.py`: comment above `assert geometry_spy.call_count == 1` clarifies the single sync expectation post-release.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps
- None; the assertion and explanatory comment now reflect the intended behavior.

:::task-stub{title="Clarify geometry sync assertion context"}
1. Open `tests/test_virtual_desktop_external_launch.py`.
2. Navigate to `test_external_app_card_sync_geometry_updates_during_drag` and locate the cleanup loop that calls `widget.deleteLater()`.
3. Replace the trailing comment with text explaining that only one geometry sync should fire after the release event finalizes the drag.
4. Ensure the subsequent line reads `assert geometry_spy.call_count == 1`.
5. Commit the change after verifying formatting.

## 2025-09-26 Drag position sync
### Objective
- Keep embedded HWNDs aligned with their Qt card containers while dragging so the surface follows the card in real time.

### Context Snippets
- `external_app_card.py`: cache `_last_embedded_origin`, throttle updates with `_last_position_sync_ts`, and call `_sync_embedded_position` during `Card.moving` to issue `SetWindowPos` with `_SWP_NOSIZE`.
- `tests/test_virtual_desktop_external_launch.py::test_external_app_card_sync_geometry_updates_during_drag`: spy on `_sync_embedded_position` to confirm drag-time sync while retaining the release-time geometry assertion.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps
- Exercise the drag flow on a Windows host to confirm the embedded surface tracks the card and verify throttling keeps CPU usage low.

:::task-stub{title="Wire ExternalAppCard drag-time position syncing"}
1. Edit `external_app_card.py` and import `QPoint` plus bind `_user32.ScreenToClient`.
2. In `ExternalAppCard.__init__`, add `_last_embedded_origin`, `_last_position_sync_ts`, and `_position_sync_interval` members initialized to `None`/`0.0`/`0.05` respectively.
3. Connect the card's `moving` signal to a new `_sync_embedded_position` handler that maps the container's top-left into the embedded window parent's client coordinates and issues `_user32.SetWindowPos` with `_SWP_NOSIZE | _SWP_NOZORDER | _SWP_NOACTIVATE` when the throttle allows.
4. Reset `_last_embedded_origin` and `_last_position_sync_ts` inside `_embed_window`, `_release_window`, and successful `_sync_geometry` calls so fresh drags recompute offsets.
5. Guard `_sync_embedded_position` against missing container/HWND handles and wrap `UpdateWindow` in a try/except after successful moves.
:::

:::task-stub{title="Update drag geometry regression test for position sync"}
1. Modify `tests/test_virtual_desktop_external_launch.py::test_external_app_card_sync_geometry_updates_during_drag` to monkeypatch `_sync_embedded_position` with a `Mock` before `attach_card` runs.
2. Reset both geometry and position spies immediately after `attach_card` to ignore connect-time emissions.
3. After simulating the drag events, assert `geometry_spy.call_count == 1` and `position_spy.call_count >= 1` to cover release and mid-drag updates.
4. Save the test file and include it in the commit alongside the widget changes.

## 2025-09-26 Cleanup loop comment tidy
### Objective
- Note the drag geometry test now documents the single-line cleanup loop that deletes both widgets.

### Context Snippets
- `tests/test_virtual_desktop_external_launch.py`: the `finally` block iterates over `(display_card, external_card)` and calls `widget.deleteLater()`.

### Suggested Next Coding Steps
- None; the comment and assertions already reflect the intended cleanup behavior.

:::task-stub{title="Document drag cleanup loop simplification"}
1. Open `tests/test_virtual_desktop_external_launch.py`.
2. Locate `test_external_app_card_sync_geometry_updates_during_drag` near the `finally` block.
3. Ensure the loop reads `for widget in (display_card, external_card):` with only `widget.deleteLater()` inside.
4. Update the adjacent comment to explain that a single geometry sync fires after the release event and at least one mid-drag position sync occurs.
5. Save the file and record the change in the session log.
