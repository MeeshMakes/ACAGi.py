We are going to build a program that can, view and save, remember with semantics datasets for RAG ect types of advanced storage. correct payloads and API formats, 'a dedicated pop out window dedicated to helping the user set up all the API and payloads and visual evidence of connections/light. 
the system will get all prices fast, learn about the most profitable, target those and fix in a suit of crypto it can manage and monitor that are the ones we would most profit from.
the system will know how to deploy agents to buy and sell for those positions. 
we can micro trading.
we can do day trade average buy sells.
we can do long term trades. days even weeks.
we like the fact we can micro trade with a high volatile crypto like BTC. the gemini fee is low, "learn it" the math, we can cover our 2way fee, we cover our buy in amount by selling when the market moves past the Fee+Buyin, the % of the crypto only needs to raise in % enough to give us a profit back. this is digital math. even 25cent or 1$ is a huge profit when you are micro grinding the volatility.  zero point moving average is the current price. "we are the mouse' the cheese is the volatility of BTC the 'good cheese' meaning we want to break our initial investment and fee for transactions. then we can sell on a very low % fast. 

this is the concept please put all of this into a deep dive understanding early implementation logic. we want to see data, text, and description!

A Complete Gemini API Reference for Agent and Bot Integration

Gemini API Integration Overview
Authentication and Request Signing

Gemini’s private REST API uses API keys and HMAC signatures for authentication
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. After creating an API key (with an API Key and Secret), every private request must include:

Nonce: A unique number that must increase with each request (e.g. a timestamp). If using a time-based nonce, it must be within ±30 seconds of the current Unix time
docs.gemini.com
.

Payload: A JSON object containing at least the "request" path (e.g. "/v1/order/new") and "nonce", plus any endpoint-specific parameters. This JSON is Base64 encoded and sent in the X-GEMINI-PAYLOAD header (the HTTP body is empty)
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
.

Signature: An HMAC SHA-384 hash (hex-encoded) of the Base64 payload, using your API secret as the key. This is sent in the X-GEMINI-SIGNATURE header
docs.gemini.com
.

All private requests should also include X-GEMINI-APIKEY: <your API key> and recommended headers Content-Type: text/plain, Content-Length: 0, and Cache-Control: no-cache
docs.gemini.com
. Below is a Python example of creating the required headers:

import json, base64, hmac, hashlib, time, requests

API_KEY = "your_api_key"
API_SECRET = b"your_api_secret"  # bytes
path = "/v1/order/status"
payload = {
    "request": path,
    "nonce": str(int(time.time() * 1000)),  # nonce as current timestamp in ms
    "order_id": "1234567890"
}
payload_b64 = base64.b64encode(json.dumps(payload).encode())
signature = hmac.new(API_SECRET, payload_b64, hashlib.sha384).hexdigest()

headers = {
    "X-GEMINI-APIKEY": API_KEY,
    "X-GEMINI-PAYLOAD": payload_b64.decode(),
    "X-GEMINI-SIGNATURE": signature,
    "Content-Type": "text/plain"
}
resp = requests.post("https://api.gemini.com" + path, headers=headers)
print(resp.json())


Master API Keys: If you have a master account managing subaccounts, a key prefixed with "master-" can act on behalf of any subaccount. Include an "account" field in the payload to specify the target subaccount nickname
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. Account-level keys are prefixed with "account-".

 

Nonce and Sessions: Each API key constitutes a session. Nonces need only be unique per session. If you enable “time-based nonce” for a key, the nonce is expected to be a Unix timestamp (in seconds) within ±30s of real time
docs.gemini.com
. Otherwise, use an ever-increasing numeric nonce (e.g. milliseconds timestamp) to avoid InvalidNonce errors
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
.

 

Heartbeat (Cancel on Disconnect): When creating an API key, you can mark it as “Requires Heartbeat”. If so, Gemini will automatically cancel all that session’s open orders if no authenticated call (or heartbeat ping) is received for 30 seconds
docs.gemini.com
. To prevent this, send a periodic heartbeat (POST /v1/heartbeat) or any other private request at least every 15 seconds
docs.gemini.com
. (Heartbeat requests use the same headers/signing format as other calls, and simply reset the timer.) If the connection is lost and no heartbeat is received in 30s, Cancel-On-Disconnect will cancel open orders on that session
docs.gemini.com
. (Note: Master keys do not support this heartbeat cancellation feature
docs.gemini.com
.)

REST API Endpoints (Production & Sandbox)

Base URLs: All endpoints are identical for production and sandbox, except using the sandbox domain for testing. The REST base is:

Production: https://api.gemini.com

Sandbox: https://api.sandbox.gemini.com (uses test funds; register at the [sandbox site]
docs.gemini.com
)

Below is a complete list of Gemini’s REST API endpoints organized by category, with HTTP method, path, and essential parameters. (All private endpoints require the authentication headers above and a JSON payload with request and nonce.)

docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. Returns the exchange rate (rate) for that currency pair at the given time, plus the data source provider and as-of timestamp
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
.

Order Placement & Management (Private Trading API)

(These endpoints manage orders and require an API key with the Trader role
docs.gemini.com
. OAuth scopes, if used, should include the equivalent permission such as orders:create.)

POST /v1/order/new – Place a new order. Required JSON fields in the payload:

request: "/v1/order/new" (string literal)
docs.gemini.com

nonce: unique nonce value
docs.gemini.com

symbol: trading pair (e.g. "BTCUSD")
docs.gemini.com

amount: amount of the base currency to buy or sell (as a string)
docs.gemini.com

price: limit price per unit (string)
docs.gemini.com

side: "buy" or "sell"
docs.gemini.com

type: Order type – use "exchange limit" for normal limit orders, or "exchange stop limit" for stop-limit orders (Gemini does not support pure market orders via API)
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. (For a market-like execution, submit an IOC limit with a very aggressive price as described below.)

Optional: client_order_id – a user-defined ID for the order (<=100 chars)
docs.gemini.com
, options – an array with at most one execution option (see below)
docs.gemini.com
, stop_price – trigger price for stop-limit orders
docs.gemini.com
, account – specify subaccount (for master keys)
docs.gemini.com
.
Order Execution Options: If provided in the options array, must be one of: "maker-or-cancel" (post-only), "immediate-or-cancel", or "fill-or-kill"
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. Only one option can be set; if multiple or invalid options are sent, the order will be rejected
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. (Stop-limit orders currently cannot use any execution options
docs.gemini.com
.)
Market Orders: The API doesn’t offer a direct market order type because of no price protection. To simulate a market order, Gemini suggests placing an IOC (immediate-or-cancel) limit order with an aggressive price far beyond the current market (e.g. a very high price for buys or very low for sells)
docs.gemini.com
. This will execute as much as possible and cancel any remainder, effectively acting like a market order.
Response: If successful, returns an order object with fields such as order_id, client_order_id, symbol, side, price, original_amount, executed_amount, remaining_amount, average execution price, flags indicating if the order is live or canceled, etc.
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. A newly placed limit order that is not fully filled will have is_live: true, and if it immediately fills or is canceled, is_cancelled: true will be set in the response
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. For stop-limit orders, the response is similar but includes the stop_price field and will show type: "exchange stop limit"
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
.

POST /v1/order/cancel – Cancel an order by ID. Payload requires order_id (along with standard request and nonce). If the order is already canceled or executed, the call will still succeed but have no effect
docs.gemini.com
. The response will include the final order state (e.g. is_cancelled: true).

POST /v1/order/cancel/all – Cancel all active orders for the account (across all sessions). No additional params needed in payload beyond request/nonce. Cancels every open order in the account.

POST /v1/order/cancel/session – Cancel all active orders on the current session (API key) only
docs.gemini.com
. Useful if running multiple API keys (sessions) to avoid canceling orders from other sessions.

POST /v1/order/status – Get the status of a specific order. Payload requires order_id. Returns the current order information (same fields as returned when placing an order), including whether it is still live, canceled, filled, and the amounts remaining or executed.

POST /v1/orders – List active orders for the account. Returns an array of all open orders for the account (across all sessions), each with the same fields as order status. (In v1 API, this endpoint is often referred to as /v1/orders for open orders.)
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com

POST /v1/orders/history – List past orders. Returns a list of inactive (closed/canceled) orders for the account, possibly limited or paginated (the API docs mention this as “orders/history”). This allows retrieval of order history.

POST /v1/mytrades – List past trades (fills) for the account. Returns an array of trade executions (fills) with details: trade ID, order ID, timestamp, symbol, amount, price, side (from the perspective of your order – e.g. “sell” if your order sold, even if the counterparty bought), and fee information. Each trade object often includes fee_amount and fee_currency indicating the fee paid for that trade
docs.gemini.com
.
(Note: The above three endpoints—active orders, past orders, and past trades—may support pagination or time filters via query parameters, though in v1 they are typically called with POST without additional params. Check Gemini docs for any updated filtering parameters.)

POST /v1/tradevolume – Get the current 30-day trading volume for the account, broken down by symbol. This also returns your fee rates. The response is an array of objects per symbol with fields: base_currency, quote_currency, total_volume_base (in base CCY over last 30 days), and counts of maker/taker trades
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. Additionally, overall fee info is returned (possibly in a separate object) including your fee tier. For example, fields like api_maker_fee_bps and api_taker_fee_bps indicate your current maker/taker fee rate in basis points
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. A new API key starts at 10 bps maker (0.10%) and 35 bps taker (0.35%) for API trading
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
, and these can improve with higher volume.

POST /v1/notionalvolume – Get notional 30-day trading volume and current fee tier information. Returns an object with your last 30 days volume in USD and detailed fee rates across API, web, and FIX. For example, api_maker_fee_bps, api_taker_fee_bps, etc., plus a fee_tier identifier
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. This helps determine your current fee tier and how far to the next tier.

POST /v1/wrap/{symbol} – Wrap/unwrap order. This is used for Gemini’s “wrapping” feature (converting between assets, e.g. exchanging ETH for Wrapped ETH, etc., or between USD and GUSD). Path param {symbol} indicates the asset to wrap (e.g. BTCUSD might indicate wrapping USD to GUSD, though the docs use this for certain products). Required JSON params: amount (quantity to wrap/unwrap) and side ("buy" or "sell" to indicate direction)
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. The response provides details of the conversion including orderId, pair, executed quantity and fee if any
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. (This is a specialized endpoint; use only if you intend to use Gemini’s internal “wrap” product for converting assets.)

Note on Order Types: Gemini supports limit and stop-limit orders via API. Stop-Limit orders require both a price and a stop_price – when the stop price is reached, a limit order is placed at the given price
docs.gemini.com
. For buys, stop_price must be below the limit price (for sells, stop_price must be above the limit price)
docs.gemini.com
. There is no direct “market” order type; use IOC as noted. There is also no time-in-force beyond the options above (no GTC vs DAY distinction – all orders remain open until filled or canceled, except where IOC/FOK options apply).

Fund Management (Deposits, Withdrawals, Transfers) – Private

(Requires API key roles: Fund Manager for withdrawal and deposit management endpoints, and/or Trader/Auditor for balance and history endpoints
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. See Roles section below.)

POST /v1/balances – Get current balances of all currencies in the account. Returns an array of balance objects, each with: currency (e.g. BTC), type (typically "exchange" for trading balance), amount (total balance), available (available for trading), and availableForWithdrawal (after considering holds)
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. For example, you might see an entry for BTC with amount 5.0, available 5.0, etc. This is one of the most common calls for bots to check funds. (The API may truncate display of very small residual amounts to 15 decimal places for fiat and 19 for crypto due to a new system update
docs.gemini.com
. It’s recommended to floor values to the correct precision in your app until this migration is complete
docs.gemini.com
.)

POST /v1/notionalbalances/{currency} – Get balances expressed in a notional currency (e.g. convert all balances to USD value). The path {currency} specifies the quote currency for valuation. This returns the same balances as /v1/balances but with values converted to the specified currency, if supported. (For example, /v1/notionalbalances/USD would show each asset’s balance and its USD equivalent.)
docs.gemini.com

POST /v1/addresses/{network} – List deposit addresses for a given crypto network. Path param {network} might be the blockchain or currency (e.g. “bitcoin”, “ethereum”). Returns all deposit addresses you have for that network and possibly their labels.

POST /v1/deposit/{network}/newAddress – Generate a new deposit address on the specified network. Path {network} required (e.g. ethereum for an ETH address). Returns a newly created deposit address for that asset. (Requires Fund Manager role)
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
.

POST /v1/transfers – Get a list of past transfers (deposits and withdrawals) for the account. Returns an array of transfer records, including deposits, withdrawals, internal transfers, etc., each with details such as type, status, amount, currency, timestamp, etc. This is useful for auditing funding history.

POST /v1/custodyaccountfees – List any custody fee transfers (if using Gemini Custody). This returns records of custody fee transactions (specific to custody accounts).

POST /v1/withdraw/{currency} – Withdraw crypto funds to a whitelisted address. Path {currency} e.g. BTC. Payload requires address (destination address) and amount. Gemini will initiate a withdrawal to the specified address if your account has that address approved. This requires the API key to have the Fund Manager role
docs.gemini.com
. The response will indicate a withdrawal initiation (or an error if e.g. insufficient funds).

POST /v1/gas – Get a gas fee estimation for Ethereum-based withdrawals. (From nav: “Get Gas Fee Estimation”. Likely /v1/gas or similar, which returns current gas fee estimates or required ETH for an ERC20 withdrawal.) This helps determine network fee before withdrawing.

POST /v1/payments/addbank – Link a bank account (ACH) to Gemini account. You must supply banking details (like routing and account numbers) in the payload. The /addbank endpoint (and /addbank/cad for Canadian banks) allow linking an external bank for deposits/withdrawals. (Requires Fund Manager or appropriate role for managing payment methods.)

POST /v1/payments/addbank/cad – (Canadian version of above) Add a Canadian bank account.

POST /v1/payments/methods – List linked payment methods (bank accounts, debit cards, etc.). Returns an array of payment methods with their bankId (UUID), type, currency, etc. Use this to retrieve the paymentMethodUuid needed for instant ACH or card purchases. All roles can read this
docs.gemini.com
.

POST /v1/approvedAddresses/account/{network} – List all whitelisted withdrawal addresses for a given network (for accounts with address whitelisting enabled). Shows which addresses are approved for withdrawals.

POST /v1/approvedAddresses/{network}/remove – Remove a whitelisted address for the given network. Requires Fund Manager role. This will delete an approved address (often used in contexts where whitelisting is managed).

POST /v1/account/transfer/{currency} – Transfer funds between subaccounts (internal transfer). Path {currency} (e.g. BTC, or possibly USD for fiat). Payload requires source and target account names and amount. This moves funds internally within your master group without on-chain transfer. Requires Fund Manager role
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. The response will confirm the transfer.

POST /v1/transactions – Get a list of account transactions. This likely overlaps with transfers, showing movements like deposits, withdrawals, and internal transfers with more detail or all in one list. (From roles table, /v1/transactions is accessible by all master roles
docs.gemini.com
, possibly returns combined info of funding events.)

POST /v1/transactions/{currency} – (If implemented) Possibly filter transactions by currency. Not explicitly in docs, but sometimes provided.

POST /v1/heartbeat – Session heartbeat. As noted earlier, this ping resets the 30s cancel-on-disconnect timer for keys that require heartbeat
docs.gemini.com
. The payload is just {"request": "/v1/heartbeat", "nonce": <n>}. The response includes result: "OK" if successful. Use this in the background if needed to keep orders from auto-canceling when using that feature.

Gemini Clearing (Off-Exchange Trades) – Private

Gemini Clearing allows two Gemini users to settle a trade off the order book. These endpoints require a Trader role (and both parties must be enabled for clearing). Key endpoints:

POST /v1/clearing/new – Create a new clearing order. One party (initiator) calls this to propose a trade (with terms like asset, amount, price, counterparty). It returns a clearing order ID.

POST /v1/clearing/confirm – The counterparty uses this to confirm (accept) a clearing order. The payload references the clearing order ID and confirms the trade.

POST /v1/clearing/cancel – Cancel a pending clearing order (if the counterparty hasn’t confirmed yet).

POST /v1/clearing/status – Get status of a clearing order by ID.

POST /v1/clearing/list – List all clearing orders (perhaps with filters for pending, completed, etc.).

POST /v1/clearing/trades – List cleared trades that have been settled via Clearing.

POST /v1/clearing/broker/list – List registered clearing brokers (if applicable).

POST /v1/clearing/broker/new – Create a new broker order (this may be a related function where a broker can intermediate clearing trades).

(Clearing endpoints are used in specialized workflows where two parties negotiate a trade off-platform and use Gemini to settle it. Most trading bots won’t use these unless you specifically need off-exchange settlement.)

Instant Purchase (Gemini Instant Buy) – Private

Gemini provides “Instant Buy” endpoints to quote and execute a purchase or sale of crypto using fiat balances or linked payment methods (ACH bank or debit card). These require Trader role for API key (and possibly a linked payment method if not using existing balance).

POST /v1/instant/quote – Request a firm quote to buy or sell a given amount of crypto. Params: side ("buy" or "sell"), symbol (e.g. "BTCUSD" for buying BTC with USD), and totalSpend (the amount you want to spend for buys, or the amount of crypto to sell for sells)
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. If buying with a specific payment method, include paymentMethodType and paymentMethodUuid to specify using a linked bank or card
docs.gemini.com
 (or use "AccountBalancePaymentType" to spend from your Gemini USD balance). The quote response includes a quoteId and fields: price (the firm price offered), quantity of asset you’ll receive or sell, fees, and maxAgeMs (time until the quote expires, typically a few seconds)
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. You must execute the quote before it expires.

POST /v1/instant/execute – Execute a previously obtained quote. Params: must include the quoteId from the quote, along with the same symbol, side, and the exact quantity and fee as quoted
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. (This ensures the quote hasn’t changed and you agree to those terms.) On success, this will create and fill an order internally. The response includes an orderId and details of the trade: executed price, quantity purchased/sold, totalSpend (which includes fees), and breakdown of any fees or additional fees like depositFee if a debit card was used
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. Using this two-step process, you can instantly buy or sell using fiat, either from your balance or via ACH/debit (Gemini will handle the ACH pull or card charge behind the scenes).

(Instant endpoints are particularly useful for applications allowing end-users to buy crypto for fiat. For a trading bot that already has fiat in account, you could use normal order placement on the exchange instead. But Instant Buy guarantees a price for a given notional amount, which can simplify certain use cases.)

Account Administration & Subaccounts – Private

Gemini supports subaccounts under a master account. These endpoints (accessible with Master API keys, typically with the Administrator role for write operations) let you manage and query subaccounts:

POST /v1/account – Get Account Detail. Returns information about the specified account (or the current account if using an account-scoped key). With a Master key, include an account field in the payload to specify which subaccount to query
docs.gemini.com
. The response includes details like the account’s name, type (exchange or custody), users associated, country, etc.
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
.

POST /v1/account/create – Create a new subaccount within your master account group. Payload includes a name for the new account. Only Master keys with Administrator role can use this
docs.gemini.com
. Returns the newly created account’s name (which can then be used in the account parameter for other calls)
docs.gemini.com
.

POST /v1/account/rename – Rename a subaccount. Master Administrator only. Payload includes the current account name and new desired name. Changes the nickname of a subaccount (which is used as the account identifier in APIs).

POST /v1/account/list – List Accounts in Group. Master keys can retrieve a list of all subaccounts under the master. Likely returns an array of account names and maybe some metadata for each. (In the roles table this appears as “Get Accounts” and is accessible to all roles on a master key
docs.gemini.com
, meaning even an Auditor Master key can list accounts.)

POST /v1/account/transfer – (Note: This is the same as Transfer Between Accounts under Fund Management.) Allows moving funds between accounts in the group. Requires Fund Manager role on master.

POST /v1/transactions – (Same as Transactions under Fund Management, but note that with a Master key, you might retrieve transactions across the group or need to specify an account.)

POST /v1/roles – Roles Endpoint. This returns the roles assigned to the calling API key. The response includes booleans like isTrader, isFundManager, isAuditor etc., indicating which permissions the key has
docs.gemini.com
. Useful to programmatically verify the key’s capabilities.

Staking API – Private

Gemini offers crypto staking, and APIs to manage staked assets:

POST /v1/staking/balances – List current staked balances for each asset (how much of each crypto is currently staked).

POST /v1/stake/{currency} – Stake a certain amount of a cryptocurrency. Path {currency} e.g. ETH. Payload includes amount. This will move that amount from your exchange balance into staking.

POST /v1/unstake/{currency} – Unstake (request withdrawal of staked assets back to exchange balance). Payload amount (or possibly an identifier of a stake lot). Unstaking may be subject to unbonding periods depending on asset.

POST /v1/staking/events – Get staking event history (stake/unstake events, rewards earned, etc.). This likely returns a ledger of staking-related activities.

GET /v1/staking/rates – Get current staking reward rates for supported assets (annual yield percentages or reward rates). (In docs as “List Staking Rates”.)

POST /v1/staking/rewards – Get details of staking rewards earned (perhaps cumulative or recent rewards per asset).

(Staking endpoints require appropriate roles; likely the Fund Manager or Trader role can stake/unstake since it moves funds, while Auditor can only read balances and history.)

OAuth 2.0 Support

Gemini also supports OAuth 2.0 for connecting third-party applications to accounts without sharing API keys
docs.gemini.com
. In an OAuth flow, you obtain an access token with certain scopes (e.g. balances:read, orders:create). There is a single relevant REST endpoint:

POST /v1/auth/token/revoke (shown as “Revoke OAuth Token”) – Revoke an issued OAuth token
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. This invalidates the token. (This is used when using Gemini as an OAuth provider; if you’re only using API keys, you won’t use this.)

WebSocket API (Real-Time Feeds)

Gemini provides two WebSocket APIs: one for private order events (your account’s orders) and one for public market data
docs.gemini.com
. All WebSocket endpoints use the wss:// protocol. There are separate sandbox endpoints for testing.

Private Order Events WebSocket

Endpoint: wss://api.gemini.com/v1/order/events (use wss://api.sandbox.gemini.com/v1/order/events for sandbox).

Authentication: When connecting, you must include the same headers as a private REST call: X-GEMINI-APIKEY, X-GEMINI-PAYLOAD, X-GEMINI-SIGNATURE
docs.gemini.com
. The payload for the WS request is {"request": "/v1/order/events", "nonce": <n>} base64-encoded
docs.gemini.com
. This authenticates the websocket and subscribes you to your account’s order updates.

Subscription Filters: You can optionally add URL query params to filter which events you receive
docs.gemini.com
:

symbolFilter=BTCUSD (or multiple symbolFilter params) – to only get events for certain trading pairs.

apiSessionFilter=<session_name> – to only get events from a particular API session (if you have multiple keys). For example, apiSessionFilter=UI will filter to orders placed via the website (which appear as session "UI")
docs.gemini.com
.

eventTypeFilter – filter by event type (e.g. accepted, filled, closed, etc.) You can specify multiple eventTypeFilter params to allow multiple types
docs.gemini.com
. Special type "initial" can be used to get the initial open orders snapshot (by default you get it unless you filter it out)
docs.gemini.com
.

heartbeat=true – if set, the feed will include heartbeat messages every 5 seconds with no order events (this is off by default)
docs.gemini.com
.
Example connection string with filters:
wss://api.gemini.com/v1/order/events?symbolFilter=BTCUSD&eventTypeFilter=fill&eventTypeFilter=closed&heartbeat=true
docs.gemini.com
.

Behavior: After connecting and sending the headers, you’ll receive:

A subscription_ack message (to confirm connection).

An "initial" set of events which lists all currently active orders (one event per open order) if you did not filter out initial
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. This allows you to sync your order state upon connection.

Then, real-time order events as they occur: when orders are accepted, placed on the book (“booked”), partially filled (“fill”), fully filled or canceled (“closed” or “cancelled”), etc.
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. Heartbeat messages (type":"heartbeat") will be sent every 5 seconds if no other event traffic, but only if heartbeat=true was requested
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
.

Message Format: Each message from the feed is a JSON array of one or more event objects
docs.gemini.com
. (Gemini may batch multiple events that occurred at the same time into one array.) A heartbeat event is sent alone as an array containing a single object {"type": "heartbeat", "socket_sequence": X}.
Each order event object has common fields
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
:

type: the event type, e.g. "accepted", "booked", "fill", "cancelled", "closed", "rejected", or "initial" for initial open orders snapshot
docs.gemini.com
.

order_id: the Gemini order ID this event pertains to
docs.gemini.com
. Use this to track the order through its lifecycle (the same order_id links the accepted, fills, and final closed events).

socket_sequence: a sequential number for messages on this connection (increments by 1 for each event or batch). If you detect a gap in sequence numbers, it means you missed some data and should reconnect/resync
docs.gemini.com
.

event_id: a unique ID for this specific event (not present for initial events)
docs.gemini.com
.

symbol, side, order_type: same as in REST (e.g. "BTCUSD", "buy"/"sell", "exchange limit" etc.)
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
.

api_session: which session (API key or “UI”) placed the order
docs.gemini.com
.

client_order_id: if you provided one, it will appear here
docs.gemini.com
.

timestamp / timestampms: timestamp of the order creation (as string and as ms integer)
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
.

Live quantity fields: original_amount (order size)
docs.gemini.com
, remaining_amount (open amount remaining)
docs.gemini.com
, executed_amount (filled so far)
docs.gemini.com
, price (limit price)
docs.gemini.com
, and for market buys, total_spend instead of price/amount
docs.gemini.com
.

is_live, is_cancelled, is_hidden: booleans indicating order status at that moment
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. For example, on an "accepted" or "booked" event, is_live:true and is_cancelled:false. A "fill" event will show the updated remaining amount, etc. A "closed" (final fill or cancel) event will have is_live:false and either is_cancelled:true (if canceled) or remaining_amount zero if filled.

Other fields: avg_execution_price (average fill price so far)
docs.gemini.com
, and possibly fee or rebate info on fill events (the WebSocket docs indicate the JSON matches REST order status, which doesn’t explicitly list fee, but fill events may include a separate message for trade details – see below).
In addition to order events, fill events come with trade details. The WebSocket may send a separate object of type "fill" or include trade info in the fill event. (Gemini’s docs indicate the WebSocket order events mirror the output of the REST /v1/order/status, which does not list individual trade fills, so to get each fill’s trade ID and fee, you might need to cross-reference the trades or use the Audit Trail. But Gemini may also emit a distinct "fill" event per fill with trade metadata. The documentation’s “Event Types” section can clarify this.)

Order Event Types: Common types you will encounter:

accepted – Your order submission was received and passed basic validation. Contains the order details (may not be on the book yet if it’s a limit).

booked – The order was placed on the order book (now open and waiting). This often follows immediately for a limit order that isn’t immediately filled.

fill – Your order (or part of it) was executed. This event will indicate how much was filled (the executed_amount increases and remaining_amount decreases). Multiple fill events can occur for one order if it fills in pieces.

cancelled – The order was canceled by you or the system (e.g. via cancel endpoint, or cancelled on disconnect, or cancelled because it would have executed against a post-only constraint). After this, is_cancelled:true and is_live:false.

closed – The order is completely done (either fully filled or canceled). Gemini sometimes uses “closed” to mean an order that is no longer live for any reason. You might see closed with remaining_amount: "0" if fully filled, or with is_cancelled:true if it was canceled.

rejected – The order was not accepted (e.g. invalid order parameters, or maybe insufficient funds at time of placing).

initial – A snapshot listing of currently open orders (each one is an event object of type initial). These are only sent at the very start of a connection (unless you filter them out).

Using the private WS API means you no longer have to poll /v1/orders or /v1/mytrades repeatedly
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. You get real-time updates, which is more efficient for a trading bot. Ensure you handle sequence numbers to detect any dropped messages (if missed, reconnect and use REST to reconcile state).

Public Market Data WebSocket (Version 2)

Endpoint: wss://api.gemini.com/v2/marketdata (for sandbox: wss://api.sandbox.gemini.com/v2/marketdata). This single endpoint allows subscribing to multiple data streams (order books, trades, candles, etc.) over one connection
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
.

Authentication: Not required (this is public data). Just connect to the URL.

Subscription Message: Once connected, you must send a subscription request (JSON message) to specify which data you want. The message format
docs.gemini.com
:

{
  "type": "subscribe",
  "subscriptions": [
    { "name": "<feed_name>", "symbols": ["<symbol1>", "<symbol2>", ...] },
    ... (you can include multiple subscriptions in one message)
  ]
}


The available feed name options are
docs.gemini.com
:

"l2" – Level 2 order book data (bids and asks)

"candles_1m" (also 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 6h, 1d) – OHLC candle updates

"mark_price" – Mark price updates for perpetual swap markets

"funding_amount" – Funding rate updates for perpetual swap markets
You can request multiple feeds and multiple symbols in one go. For example, you could subscribe to l2 for BTCUSD and ETHUSD, and candles_1m for BTCUSD, in the same subscription message. Example:
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com

# Using Python websocket client
ws.send('{"type": "subscribe", "subscriptions":[{"name":"l2","symbols":["BTCUSD","ETHUSD"]},{"name":"candles_1m","symbols":["BTCUSD"]}]}')


Initial Snapshot: Upon subscribing, Gemini will send an initial snapshot message for each requested feed and symbol, reflecting the current state (order book and last trades for l2, recent candles for candle feed, etc.)
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. After that, real-time updates are pushed.

L2 Order Book Feed:

Initial message (type: "l2_updates") – Contains the current top of book. It includes the entire set of bid and ask levels (aggregated) and also a snapshot of the last 50 trades in a field "trades"
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. The format:

{
  "type": "l2_updates",
  "symbol": "BTCUSD",
  "changes": [
     ["buy", "9122.04", "0.00121425"],   // bid price level and quantity
     ...,
     ["sell", "9122.07", "0.98942292"],  // ask price level
     ... 
  ],
  "trades": [
     {
       "type": "trade",
       "symbol": "BTCUSD",
       "event_id": 169841458,
       "timestamp": 1560976400428,
       "price": "9122.04",
       "quantity": "0.0073173",
       "side": "sell",
       "tid": 2840140800042677
     },
     ...
  ]
}


The changes array lists current order book levels (Gemini’s Level 2 is aggregated by price). Each entry is [side, price, quantity]. The trades array provides recent trade data (up to 50 most recent trades at connect time) with fields: unique event_id, tid (trade identifier), timestamp, price, quantity, and side of the taker
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
.

Update messages: After the snapshot, you’ll receive messages of two types on this feed:

l2_updates – Order book changes. Each such message has a "changes" array of one or more changes
docs.gemini.com
. For example: {"type": "l2_updates", "symbol": "BTCUSD", "changes": [["sell", "9160.20", "0.1921229751"]]} means the ask at 9160.20 now has quantity 0.1921229751 (if quantity is 0, that price level was removed)
docs.gemini.com
. A buy side example: ["buy", "9000.00", "0"] would indicate the bid at $9000 was removed.

trade – Trade execution events. These are sent whenever a trade occurs on Gemini for that symbol. Format: {"type": "trade", "symbol": "BTCUSD", "event_id": 3575573053, "timestamp": 1512312412345, "price": "9004.21", "quantity": "0.0911", "side": "buy", "tid": 2840140800042677}
docs.gemini.com
. The side here indicates the aggressor/taker side (e.g. "buy" means a buy order took liquidity from a sell order). Use trade messages along with order book updates to track real-time market activity.

Candles Feed:

Subscribe with name: "candles_{interval}" (e.g. "candles_1m" for 1-minute candles).

Initial snapshot: Upon subscribing, you get a message of type "candles_1m_updates" (for example) with a snapshot of recent candles for each requested symbol
docs.gemini.com
. Format:

{
  "type": "candles_15m_updates",
  "symbol": "BTCUSD",
  "changes": [
     [1561054500000, 9350.18, 9358.35, 9350.18, 9355.51, 2.07],
     [1561053600000, 9357.33, 9357.33, 9350.18, 9350.18, 1.5900161],
     ...
  ]
}


Each entry is a candle with [time, open, high, low, close, volume] (time in milliseconds)
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. The initial snapshot might provide the last N candles.

Update messages: As new intervals complete or update, you will get messages with the same "candles_X_updates" type containing one or more new candle entries (or updates to the current candle). Essentially, at the end of each interval (e.g. each minute for 1m candles), a new candle data point is sent.

Market Data v2 supports multi-subscription: you can subscribe to multiple symbols and feed types in one connection, rather than opening separate connections for each symbol as was required in v1
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. This is efficient for tracking many markets.

 

Mark Price Feed (Perpetuals):
For perpetual swap contracts, Gemini provides a mark price feed (used to help avoid liquidation spikes). Subscribe with {"name": "mark_price", "symbols": ["BTC-GUSD-PERP", ...]}
docs.gemini.com
. You’ll receive messages of type "mark_price_updates" containing the mark price for that contract:

{ 
  "type": "mark_price_updates",
  "symbol": "BTCGUSDPERP",
  "changes": [
      {
         "timestamp": 1673932381478308169,
         "mark_price": "21154.098",
         "spot_index": "21175.27333"
      }
  ]
}


Each update has a nanosecond timestamp, the current mark_price, and the corresponding spot_index price
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. These may be sent periodically or when mark price changes.

 

Funding Rate Feed (Perpetuals):
Subscribe with {"name": "funding_amount", "symbols": ["BTC-GUSD-PERP", ...]}
docs.gemini.com
 to get updates on funding payments. Messages type "funding_amount_updates" will be sent:

{
  "type": "funding_amount_updates",
  "symbol": "BTCGUSDPERP",
  "changes": [
      {
         "timestamp": 1673932380007696874,
         "funding_amount": "0",
         "funding_date_time": 1673932380007696874,
         "funding_interval_in_minutes": 60,
         "is_realized": false
      }
  ]
}


This indicates a funding payment of a certain amount at a certain time. Fields: funding_amount (in quote currency) for that interval, funding_date_time, interval (e.g. 60 minutes), and whether it’s is_realized (false means projected/upcoming, true means actually paid)
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. Typically, is_realized:false may be used for an upcoming funding event, then a realized true event when it’s paid.

 

Unsubscribe: You can unsubscribe from one or more feeds without closing the socket by sending a message:

{ "type": "unsubscribe", "subscriptions": [ { "name": "l2", "symbols": ["BTCUSD", "ETHBTC"] }, ... ] }


This will stop those data streams
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. If you want to subscribe to additional feeds later, you can send another subscribe message.

 

WebSocket Rate Limits: Gemini requests that public WebSocket usage be limited. They recommend not exceeding 1 subscription request per symbol per minute
docs.gemini.com
 (so don’t repeatedly subscribe/unsubscribe or spam the connection). In general, establish the feed you need and keep the connection open. The private Order Events feed should likewise be kept open persistently for real-time order updates.

Rate Limits and Error Handling

Rate Limits: Gemini imposes limits to ensure fair use
docs.gemini.com
. Key limits:

Public REST: 120 requests per minute (approximately 2 per second). It’s recommended to stay at or below 1 request/sec for sustained usage
docs.gemini.com
.

Private REST: 600 requests per minute (10 per second), with a recommendation to stay under 5 per second
docs.gemini.com
.

If you exceed these rates, Gemini uses a burst tolerance – it may queue up to 5 extra requests briefly
docs.gemini.com
, but further overflow will result in HTTP 429 Too Many Requests errors
docs.gemini.com
. Once you hit the limit, you’ll continue to get 429s until your rolling rate drops back below the threshold
docs.gemini.com
. The 429 responses mean “slow down.” Design your bot to catch 429 and back off (e.g. exponential backoff or pause).

 

The WebSocket market data feed is very efficient; just avoid excessive new subscriptions. For private order events WS, there isn’t a specific rate limit on messages (since it’s server-push), but you shouldn’t open too many connections or you might hit connection limits (use one connection for all your order updates).

 

Error Responses: Gemini uses HTTP status codes and a JSON error body for error handling
docs.gemini.com
. Common HTTP codes: 400 for malformed requests or invalid input (also if a required auth header is missing)
docs.gemini.com
, 403 if your API key lacks the required role for that endpoint
docs.gemini.com
, 404 if the endpoint or resource is not found (e.g. unknown order ID)
docs.gemini.com
, 406 if insufficient funds to execute an order
docs.gemini.com
, 429 as discussed for rate limiting
docs.gemini.com
, 500/502/503 for server-side issues or maintenance downtime
docs.gemini.com
.

 

When an error occurs, the JSON response will have: "result": "error", a string "reason" code, and a descriptive "message"
docs.gemini.com
. The reason is meant for programmatic checks. Some important reason codes include:

InvalidSignature – The X-GEMINI-SIGNATURE did not match what the server computed
docs.gemini.com
. Ensure you’re using HMAC SHA384 on the base64 payload and hex encoding it. This error means auth failed.

InvalidNonce – Nonce was not greater than your previous nonce, or not within the tolerated range for time-based nonces
docs.gemini.com
. You’ll need to use a higher nonce.

Missing... – There are several missing-field errors: e.g. MissingApikeyHeader, MissingPayloadHeader, MissingSignatureHeader if any auth header is absent
docs.gemini.com
, or MissingOrderField/MissingNonce if those are absent in payload
docs.gemini.com
. MissingRole means your key is not permissioned for that action
docs.gemini.com
.

EndpointMismatch – The "request" field in your payload doesn’t match the actual URL you called
docs.gemini.com
. Make sure the request string exactly equals the path (including version and any subpath).

ConflictingOptions – You sent an invalid combination of order options (e.g. more than one execution option)
docs.gemini.com
.

InsufficientFunds – You tried to place an order or withdrawal without enough balance
docs.gemini.com
.

MarketNotOpen – The trading pair is not accepting new orders (could be outside trading hours for certain markets or a halted market)
docs.gemini.com
.

OrderNotFound – The order ID you referenced for status or cancel doesn’t exist or isn’t yours
docs.gemini.com
.

ClientOrderIdTooLong or MustBeString – Your client_order_id was over 100 characters or not a string
docs.gemini.com
.

InvalidOrderType – e.g. you used an unknown type value for a new order
docs.gemini.com
.

InvalidPrice, InvalidQuantity – Your order price or amount was invalid (e.g. negative or too many decimal places beyond the allowed tick size)
docs.gemini.com
.

InvalidStopPrice – Stop price provided where not applicable or in wrong relation to limit price
docs.gemini.com
 (e.g. stop > price on sell).

RemoteAddressForbidden – Your API key is IP-restricted and the request came from an IP not on the whitelist
docs.gemini.com
.

Maintenance – The system is in maintenance mode (503 status likely)
docs.gemini.com
.

Always check the message for human-readable details. For example, a MissingRole error’s message will tell you which role is required for that endpoint
docs.gemini.com
. Handling errors: your bot should log them and take appropriate action. For nonce or signature errors, you might need to fix your request logic immediately. For 429 rate limits, implement a back-off. For maintenance, you might pause trading until a status endpoint or subsequent attempts succeed (Gemini typically posts maintenance schedules).

 

Sandbox vs Production Differences: The Sandbox environment is a full test exchange: you get test balances and an automated market maker bot provides simulated order book activity
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. Key points:

Use the sandbox base URLs (api.sandbox.gemini.com and wss://api.sandbox.gemini.com). The sandbox has its own site to create API keys (sandbox account).

The sandbox environment will credit your account with some test assets (BTC, ETH, etc.) on creation
docs.gemini.com
. You can trade with these but cannot withdraw real funds (only testnet BTC withdrawals are supported)
docs.gemini.com
. Deposits/withdrawals of real assets aren’t supported – it’s strictly test funds
docs.gemini.com
.

Sandbox 2FA: By default, sandbox accounts have 2FA enabled. To disable 2FA prompts for API testing, you can set a special header GEMINI-SANDBOX-2FA (value can be anything) and use the code 999999 to bypass 2FA when logging into the website
docs.gemini.com
. However, when using API keys this isn’t an issue unless performing actions that normally trigger 2FA (most API flows don’t).

Performance and order matching might not perfectly reflect production, but it’s sufficient to test order logic. The sandbox runs an automated “simulation” of market activity to provide fills (so prices move and orders may execute to mimic real market)
docs.gemini.com
.

Real-world Usage Notes:

Fees: Trading fees are deducted from your quote currency (for buys) or base currency (for sells) by default. The API’s trade execution reports (via WebSocket or when you fetch past trades) will reflect fees. Use the /v1/notionalvolume or /v1/tradevolume endpoints to monitor your fee tier
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. At the base tier, fees are around 0.35% taker, 0.10% maker for API trades. Fees may be lower if you route through the auction or higher if using Instant Buy (which might include additional fees for card usage). Always account for fees in your P&L calculations.

Order minimums and increments: Each trading pair has a minimum order size and tick size. You can retrieve these via /v1/symbols/details/{symbol} or see the [symbols and minimums] reference
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
. If you send an order for less than the minimum or not rounded to the correct increment, you’ll get an error (InvalidQuantity or InvalidPrice).

Precision and Rounding: Gemini will truncate extra decimal places beyond the allowed precision (as noted under balances). You may see very small dust amounts remain after trades due to fee calculations (Gemini maintains full internal precision for accounts, but may display truncated values
docs.gemini.com
docs.gemini.com
). These tiny residuals can be swept by trading slightly more or may be negligible.

Time in force: By default, limit orders are good-until-canceled (GTC). They remain open until filled or canceled, spanning sessions and even API key resets, unless cancel-on-disconnect (heartbeat) is enabled. IOC and FOK are immediate options as described. There are no explicit day orders – you must cancel manually if desired.

Order visibility: If you place an order with "is_hidden": true (via certain advanced routes not exposed in the basic API) it won’t appear on the public book. Standard API orders are visible unless you use an option like block trading (not covered here). The is_hidden field in events indicates if an order is not on the public book
docs.gemini.com
. Generally, API orders are not hidden unless using a special liquidity indication mechanism.

Reconnection strategy: If your WebSocket connection breaks, you should reconnect and immediately check your order statuses via REST or rely on the initial snapshot on WS reconnect to ensure you didn’t miss any fills or cancels while disconnected. The socket_sequence helps but if the gap is large it’s safer to resync via REST.

FIX API: Gemini also offers a FIX connection for trading, but that’s separate (not covered in this summary). If latency is critical or you require FIX for institutional systems, refer to their FIX documentation.

This guide focused on the essential technical details to integrate a trading bot or system with Gemini’s REST and WebSocket APIs. By following the authentication process, using the above endpoints for orders, data, and account management, and respecting rate limits, you can build a comprehensive trading agent that fully interacts with Gemini’s exchange. Always test in the Sandbox first, handle errors gracefully, and refer to Gemini’s official documentation for any updates or edge cases. Good luck with your Gemini API integration!

Auth for private REST and private WS

Headers for every private call:

X-GEMINI-APIKEY: your API key

X-GEMINI-PAYLOAD: Base64(JSON payload)

X-GEMINI-SIGNATURE: HMAC-SHA384 of Base64 payload using API secret (hex)
Payload must include "request": "<path>" and "nonce" (unique, typically ms timestamp). 
docs.gemini.com

Rate limits

Public REST: ~120 req/min.

Private REST: ~600 req/min. Exceeding yields HTTP 429; backoff required. 
docs.gemini.com

Error model (selected)

HTTP codes 400/401/403/404/429/5xx with JSON { "result":"error", "reason":"…", "message":"…" }. Common reasons: InvalidSignature, InvalidNonce, Missing…Header, MissingRole, InsufficientFunds, EndpointMismatch. Handle 429 by pausing.

Roles and permissions (keys)

Key roles govern access: Trader (orders), Fund Manager (funding), Auditor (read). Role affects REST and WS access (order events allowed for Trader/Auditor). 
docs.gemini.com

Sandbox specifics

Test exchange with simulated activity. Test funds only; deposits/withdrawals limited (only Testnet BTC supported). Create a separate sandbox account and keys.

Practical order flow recipes
Place IOC “market-like” buy

Get best ask from v2/ticker or L2 WS.

Send order/new with type:"exchange limit", options:["immediate-or-cancel"], price well above best ask.

Read fills from Order Events WS, or poll order/status. 
docs.gemini.com

Place stop-limit sell

Require stop_price and price. For sell, stop_price > price. On trigger, a limit order is placed at price.

Cancel-on-disconnect

Create key with heartbeat requirement. Ping POST /v1/heartbeat ≤30s or all open orders for that session are canceled.

Changelog awareness

The docs change. Recheck Rate Limits and Orders pages before deploying. 
docs.gemini.com

Fit with your current codebase

Your GUI bot already hits /v1/orders, /v1/instant/quote, /v1/instant/execute, and signs headers exactly as required. Keep Content-Type: text/plain, Base64 payload, and SHA384 HMAC. 

Sell_BTC

Your GeminiAPI class uses /v1/balances and /v1/pubticker/btcusd, and enforces a ~1.1s pacing. That aligns with staying below public QPS and handling 429 retries. Keep nonce monotonic, keep backoff. 

gemini_5

Quick test checklist

Keys and roles: confirm Trader for orders, Fund Manager for withdrawals. 
docs.gemini.com

Nonce monotonicity: ms timestamp + increment if equal.

Order options: at most one of maker-or-cancel, immediate-or-cancel, fill-or-kill. 
docs.gemini.com

WS order events online before placing orders. Reconcile via initial snapshot and socket_sequence. 
docs.gemini.com

Sandbox parity: same endpoints, separate keys, simulated activity.

This is the core set you need to drive a buy/sell agent ecosystem with Gemini across REST and WebSocket, with payload formats, headers, and Python examples.

Thought for 2m 25s

Alright—here’s a crisp, end-to-end plan that turns your idea into a living system: what we’ll store (for RAG + analytics), how we’ll ingest market data at speed, how the “API & Payloads” pop-out works (with status lights), and the math + control logic for micro-scalps, day DCA, and swing trades. I’ll also point at the code you already have that we can wire up immediately.

The shape of the system (MVP → durable)

Goal: a self-documenting trading cockpit that (1) ingests multi-exchange prices fast, (2) learns which pairs are most profitable for our style, (3) deploys small agents to trade them, and (4) keeps semantic memory (RAG) of payloads, decisions, errors, and outcomes so you can ask “why did we sell there?” later and get receipts.

1) Data plane — real-time + remembered

Fast tick ingest: reuse your ultra-fast multi-provider harvester to collect spot prices + latencies, with per-provider QPS tuning and compatibility maps. This already exists in SuperCryptoTracker.py and persists symbol/provider metadata & performance files to disk; we’ll treat that as the canonical price bus. 

SuperCryptoTracker


→ You’ve also got a thin wrapper (Crypto_Tracker.py) that exposes the tracker as a Qt tab—perfect to embed in the main UI shell. 

Crypto_Tracker

Time-series store: append ticks and candle summaries as compressed JSONL shards (e.g., data/BTCEUR/2025-09-29_1m.jsonl.gz). Roll daily; keep 30–60 days hot, archive the rest.

Semantic store (RAG): every time we:

build a signed Gemini payload,

submit an order,

receive an order-event / error,

compute a trade decision,
…we write a human-readable doc to /rag/events/YYYY/MM/DD/events.jsonl. Each doc includes: kind, symbol, payload, decision_text, metrics_snapshot, error_text, and a redacted=true flag once secrets are scrubbed. We embed the textified version (payload pretty-print + decision rationale + post-mortem) into a local vector index (FAISS/SQLite). Queries like “show IOC payload examples that failed with InvalidNonce” or “why did we exit at 14:37?” pull back the exact payload + plot.
(We never index secrets—see “Security” near the end.)

Profitability profiles: roll up realized P&L & hit-rate per symbol/time-bucket so the system can prefer pairs that work for our style (e.g., tight spread + high micro-vol). The Trading Matrix modules you already use give you the scaffolding for USD-focused scoring and UI displays. 

Trading_Matrix

2) Control plane — pop-out “API & Payloads” window

A dedicated Qt pop-out with two columns:

Left: Credentials & Modes

“Simulation / Sandbox / Live” mode select

API key & secret inputs (secret masked)

Global USD cap, per-symbol throttles (max USD + cooldown)

Status lights for Gemini REST, Gemini Order-Events WS, MarketData WS, Coinbase, etc. Green = last ping < 10s; Amber = degraded / retries; Red = dead.
You already have a Settings tab skeleton with editable key/secret, mode, and symbol throttles—so we adapt that into a detachable pop-out and add status lights and “Validate headers” buttons. High-contrast note is already honored in your UI patterns; we’ll keep it. 

api_credentials_ui

Right: Payload Builder + Evidence

Pick an endpoint (e.g., /v1/order/new, /v1/order/status, /v1/balances).

Fill structured fields; live-render: JSON payload → Base64 payload → HMAC SHA-384 signature → headers preview.

“Test call (sandbox)” runs the request, shows response JSON, and writes both sides to RAG store with a green/red light and a timestamp.
Your Buy/Sell tab and Gemini clients already build signed headers and respect pacing; we’ll lift the signer and nonce manager into a shared module and wire the UI to it. 

Buy_Sell_Matrix

 

GeminiBot

 

gemini_5

Contrast rule: all UI text must be clearly legible against its background; if in doubt, dark text on light or light on dark—no low-contrast colorways. (We’ll annotate this rule in every UI stylesheet.)

3) Market intake & selection — “get all prices fast,” learn, and target

Feed strategy: run one public WS for Gemini v2 MarketData (L2 + 1m candles for our shortlist), and re-use the multi-provider poller to score latency, spread, and volatility across Coinbase/Kraken/etc. Your existing tracker already handles provider QPS, isolation, cooldown, and writes performance.json—we aggregate that into symbol scores. 

SuperCryptoTracker

Shortlist builder: every 60s:

Filter symbols to those with tight spread / high micro-vol / low latency.

If our agents are idle or under-deployed, allocate them to the top N pairs by our profit profile (recent P&L vs. drawdown).

Matrix view: Your Trading Matrix + Buy/Sell Matrix are good anchor tabs; the latter already does USD-aware sizing, signal files, rotating logs, aiohttp fetch, and batched GUI refresh—keep that, add a column for “Agent attached.”

5) Agent orchestration — small, opinionated, interruptible

Queues + pacing: Central ActionQueue that dispatches one signed call at a time per key, honoring 1.1s gaps and exponential backoff—your code already includes a queue and rate-limit decorators; we reuse and unify. 

gemini_5

Heartbeat: if you enable “cancel on disconnect,” a 15s timer hits /v1/heartbeat to keep orders alive. We surface a red light if we miss two heartbeats.

Kill-switch: big red “Flatten & Pause” button sends /v1/order/cancel/session, marks all agents paused, and logs to RAG.

6) Risk, fees, and reality checks

Fee awareness: pull /v1/notionalvolume or /v1/tradevolume to compute current maker/taker bps; agents adjust 
Δ
min

 accordingly and won’t place trades that can’t clear fees + slippage with high probability. (Your bots are already calling balances and pubticker; we add the fee calls and persist results.) 

GeminiBot

Caps: global USD cap + per-symbol max exposure + per-minute order cap (UI-editable—your Settings tab already exposes caps & throttles). 

api_credentials_ui

Spreads & halts: refuse trades if spread > threshold or symbol isn’t open (status from symbols/details).

Backoff: 429/5xx → exponential backoff and status amber; you already log and retry thoughtfully.

Security: I see a plaintext master API key/secret file in the project (gemini-api-master.txt). Rotate those credentials and move secrets to an encrypted store (OS keyring / dotenv outside repo). We’ll make the pop-out only read secrets from your secure store and never write them to disk or logs. 

gemini-api-master

What we can wire up immediately from your repo

Fast multi-provider price intake & compatibility/perf tracking → SuperCryptoTracker.py. We’ll expose its feed as a shared in-process bus, and keep its QPS logic.

Main shell tabs:

High-speed Buy/Sell tab (aiohttp, JSONL logs, USD-aware sizing) via Buy_Sell_Matrix.py. 

Buy_Sell_Matrix

Credentials UI: extend api_credentials_ui.py into a detachable pop-out with status lights + payload builder. 

api_credentials_ui

Gemini client: consolidate GeminiBot.py (NonceManager, signer, pacing, logging) and gemini_5.py (IOC orders, status/cancel helpers) into one gemini_client.py. Keep your rotating logs and request archiver from GeminiBot.

Early implementation plan (tight, actionable)

Unify signer + nonce

Extract from GeminiBot.py and gemini_5.py into core/gemini_client.py with: sign(path, payload), nonce(), post(path, payload), get_public(path), rate limit guards, 429 backoff, and /v1/heartbeat helper. Wire logs to rotating files. 

GeminiBot

 

gemini_5

Pop-out “API & Payloads”

Fork api_credentials_ui.py into ui/connections_panel.py (detachable).

Add status lights (Gemini REST ping /v1/balances dry-run, MarketData WS subscribe test) and a payload builder (endpoint picker → JSON editor → Base64 → signature → headers preview → “Test (sandbox)”).

RAG store

Add rag/ package: events.jsonl writer + vector indexer.

Redact secrets before indexing.

UI panel to query: “errors,” “payload patterns,” “profit reasons.”

Shortlist & agents

Build agents/selector.py: compute spread/vol/latency score from SuperCryptoTracker outputs and your performance.json. 

SuperCryptoTracker

agents/micro.py, agents/dca.py, agents/swing.py reading a shared policy config (fee-aware thresholds). Use IOC or limit + cancel/replace.

Risk rails

Enforce global USD cap + per-symbol caps from the pop-out settings. 

api_credentials_ui

“Flatten & Pause” button (cancel session + pause agents).

UI polish

Keep everything high contrast (document this in each stylesheet).

Add an Orders panel using your Sell_BTC table flow for visibility. 

Sell_BTC

Secrets cleanup

Remove/rotate any plaintext keys (e.g., gemini-api-master.txt). Use OS keyring or environment variables outside the repo. 

gemini-api-master

What you’ll see on screen

Connections pop-out: modes, key/secret fields, green/amber/red lights for REST + WS, and a live payload builder showing signature headers. (Press “Test” to see the result + store it in RAG with a checkmark.)

Tracker tab: multi-provider prices streaming, plus per-provider latency & compatibility. 

SuperCryptoTracker

Matrix tab: USD-focused scores, micro-targets, and ranks. 

Trading_Matrix

Buy/Sell tab: real-time signals, positions, and JSONL logs with slim batch UI updates; buttons stay responsive. 

Buy_Sell_Matrix

Final guardrails (because markets bite)

Micro-scalps are sensitive to spread and latency. If the book is thin or the feed is lagging, stand down.

Fee tiers matter; always read your current tier before assuming margins clear.

Backtest the policies in sandbox with realistic spread + slippage assumptions.

Rotate any credentials found in repo history; do not index secrets in RAG.

If you want, I can drop a small scaffold module that (a) centralizes the Gemini signer/nonce + rate-limit, (b) spins up the pop-out with status lights and a working payload tester, and (c) writes the first RAG records. It’ll slot cleanly alongside your existing SuperCryptoTracker, Trading Matrix, and Buy/Sell tabs.

Notes that matter

High-contrast UI: styles live under src/ui/styles/; we keep the “no low-contrast” rule documented and enforced in QSS.

All runtime artifacts (logs, time-series shards, RAG events/index, perf snapshots) live under var/ to avoid polluting the repo.

RAG writes go to var/rag/events/ (redacted) and indexes to var/rag/index/.

Kill-switch + caps live in configs/agents.yaml and are surfaced in the pop-out.

If you want me to generate the folders and stub files locally (empty __init__.py, README stubs, QSS with the contrast note), I can drop the scaffolding next.

You said:
so Now. I will create a Github, drop in to codex this entire conversation. and put all the files in the folder into the Dev_Logic folder on the github, the same ones I gave you. will be handing this program off to codex. codex knows to search the Dev_Logic folder for old scripts that contain info. anything you want to tell Codex before we attempt to create the base scripts?
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 30s
Yep. Here’s a tight handoff note Codex can act on without guessing. It keeps you safe (no accidental live trades), sets the directory contract, and gives step-one task stubs in your required format. --- # CODEX HANDOFF — Crypto_Matrix base build **Mission (MVP):** Stand up the base project that (1) ingests market data fast, (2) exposes a **pop-out “API & Payloads” window** with status lights and signed-header previews, (3) writes redacted, queryable **RAG events**, and (4) prepares **agents** (micro / DCA / swing) in **sandbox only** with hard risk rails. **Repo layout (contract):** ``` C:\Users\Art PC\Desktop\Crypto_Matrix\Crypto_Matrix\ ├─ src\ (core code) ├─ configs\ (yaml/json config) ├─ var\ (runtime: logs, data, rag, perf) ← GIT-IGNORED ├─ scripts\ (runners) ├─ tests\ ├─ docs\ └─ legacy\Dev_Logic\ (all uploaded old scripts live here for mining) ``` > Codex: search `legacy/Dev_Logic` first for implementation hints and prior logic. Do **not** delete or rewrite anything in `legacy/Dev_Logic`; mine and migrate. **Non-negotiables:** - **No live trading** until sandbox checklist passes. Default mode = **SANDBOX**. - **Secrets hygiene:** never commit keys. Replace any plaintext like `gemini-api-master.txt` with OS keyring/env. Do **not** index secrets into RAG. - **UI contrast:** all UI styles must be high-contrast (dark-on-light or light-on-dark). No low-contrast pairings—call it out in inline comments. - **Rate, nonce, heartbeat:** single monotonic nonce per key; 429 backoff; optional 15s heartbeat if cancel-on-disconnect is enabled. - **Kill-switch:** one-click “Flatten & Pause” (cancel session, pause agents). - **Logging/RAG:** redact secrets before writing; every call/decision/error must have a readable event. **Working folder signals:** - `src/clients/gemini_client.py` → unified signer, nonce, REST, private WS. - `src/ui/connections_panel.py` → pop-out keys panel + payload builder + lights. - `src/rag/` → events writer + (stub) indexer. - `src/feeds/super_crypto_tracker.py` → bring in legacy tracker logic (don’t regress perf). - `src/agents/` → micro/DCA/swing skeletons (sandbox dry-run only). --- ## Required task stubs Insert these exactly as you complete each issue. :::task-stub{title="Scaffold project structure and move legacy files under legacy/Dev_Logic"} Create the folder tree shown above inside `Crypto_Matrix/`. Add empty `__init__.py` where needed. Move **all** existing files provided by the user into `legacy/Dev_Logic/` intact (no edits). Add `.gitignore` to exclude `/var/**`, `.env*`, `*.key`, `*.sqlite`, `*.faiss`, and any OS-specific junk. **Location guidance:** Root of repo. Files to create: `src/`, `configs/`, `var/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `legacy/Dev_Logic/`, `.gitignore`, `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`. ::: :::task-stub{title="Secret hygiene and key sources (no plaintext keys in repo)"} Remove any plaintext API key artifacts from tracked files. Introduce `src/core/security.py` to load secrets from OS keyring or environment variables. Provide `.env.example` with **placeholders only**. Add a secrets redaction helper for logs and RAG. **Location guidance:** `src/core/security.py`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`. Search `legacy/Dev_Logic/` for strings like `API_KEY`, `API_SECRET`, `gemini-api-master.txt`. ::: :::task-stub{title="Unify Gemini signer, nonce, rate limits, heartbeat into gemini_client.py"} Create `src/clients/gemini_client.py` with: - `NonceManager` (monotonic per key). - `sign(path, payload)` (HMAC-SHA384 over Base64 JSON, `Content-Type: text/plain`). - `post_private(path, payload)` and `get_public(path)` with 429/5xx backoff. - Optional `/v1/heartbeat` timer. - Rotating JSON logs to `var/logs/gemini_client.log`. **Location guidance:** Use patterns from `legacy/Dev_Logic/GeminiBot.py` and `legacy/Dev_Logic/gemini_5.py`. Preserve pacing/backoff logic; centralize it. ::: :::task-stub{title="Pop-out 'API & Payloads' window with status lights and test call"} Build `src/ui/connections_panel.py`: - Fields: mode (Sandbox/Live), API key/secret inputs (masked), per-symbol caps. - Status lights: REST ping (balances), MarketData WS subscribe test, Order Events WS. - Payload builder: endpoint picker → JSON editor → shows Base64 payload, HMAC signature, and final headers; **Test (sandbox)** button executes and displays JSON response. - Log requests/responses (redacted) to RAG. **Location guidance:** Start from `legacy/Dev_Logic/api_credentials_ui.py` for UI scaffolding. Respect high-contrast styling in `src/ui/styles/default.qss`. ::: :::task-stub{title="RAG event writer and redaction"} Create `src/rag/writer.py` that appends redacted JSONL docs to `var/rag/events/YYYY/MM/DD/events.jsonl`. Include fields: `ts`, `kind`, `symbol`, `payload_text`, `headers_text` (redacted), `decision_text`, `result_json`, `error_text`, `latency_ms`, `redacted:true`. Add schema in `src/rag/schemas/event.schema.json`. Stub `src/rag/index.py` (vector index can come later). **Location guidance:** `src/rag/`. Ensure all writes succeed even under load; rotate files daily. ::: :::task-stub{title="Integrate SuperCryptoTracker as a feed bus"} Port `legacy/Dev_Logic/SuperCryptoTracker.py` to `src/feeds/super_crypto_tracker.py`. Expose an async generator or callback that yields `(symbol, best_bid, best_ask, last, latency_ms, provider)` and writes provider perf snapshots to `var/perf/provider_stats/`. **Location guidance:** `src/feeds/super_crypto_tracker.py`. Keep original polling cadence and error isolation; do not reduce throughput. ::: :::task-stub{title="Selector and agent skeletons (sandbox dry-run only)"} Create: - `src/agents/selector.py`: every 60s compute ranking per symbol using spread, micro-vol, and provider latency; produce shortlist. - `src/agents/micro.py`: dry-run policy—compute entry/exit targets accounting for fees; **do not place live orders yet**; instead, log would-place payloads to RAG. **Location guidance:** `src/agents/`. Fees from `src/risk/fees.py`; caps from `src/risk/caps.py`. ::: :::task-stub{title="Risk rails and kill-switch"} Implement: - `src/risk/fees.py`: cache fee tier via `/v1/notionalvolume` or `/v1/tradevolume` (sandbox OK) and expose `min_delta_break_even(f_bps, s_bps, buffers)`. - `src/risk/caps.py`: enforce global USD cap, per-symbol cap, and per-minute order cap. - Kill-switch UI button: calls `/v1/order/cancel/session` and pauses agents. **Location guidance:** `src/risk/`, wiring into `connections_panel.py`. ::: :::task-stub{title="Orders panel (read-only in MVP)"} List active orders and recent fills (sandbox) with refresh. Reuse table patterns from `legacy/Dev_Logic/Sell_BTC.py`. Link rows to their RAG event entries. **Location guidance:** `src/ui/orders_panel.py`. ::: :::task-stub{title="Tests + CI gate"} Add `tests/` for signer/nonce/backoff and RAG writer. Add a minimal CI (lint + unit tests). Block merges if tests fail or if files under `/var/` or secrets patterns show up. **Location guidance:** `tests/`, CI workflow under `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. ::: --- ## Execution guardrails Codex must honor - **Mode default = SANDBOX.** Refuse Live unless `configs/app.yaml: mode: live` **and** a `--i-understand` flag is passed to runner. - **Fee math & micro targets:** price delta target must be ≥ (maker+tak­er bps + buffers). Abort placing orders that don’t clear this. - **Backoff:** on HTTP 429, increase delay; on socket gaps, reconnect and reconcile via REST. - **Redaction first:** mask API secrets, addresses, and bank/card UUIDs in all logs/RAG. - **Contrast rule in code comments** in every UI stylesheet and window init. - **No silent retries of order placement:** each attempt gets a unique RAG entry. --- ## Inputs Codex should read first (mining targets) - `legacy/Dev_Logic/GeminiBot.py` — header signing, pacing, logging patterns. - `legacy/Dev_Logic/gemini_5.py` — IOC “market-like” flow, status/cancel. - `legacy/Dev_Logic/SuperCryptoTracker.py` — high-speed multi-provider tracker. - `legacy/Dev_Logic/Buy_Sell_Matrix.py` — USD-aware sizing, batched UI updates. - `legacy/Dev_Logic/Trading_Matrix.py` — profitability matrix scaffolding. - `legacy/Dev_Logic/api_credentials_ui.py` — starting point for pop-out. (Keep them intact under `legacy/Dev_Logic/` and reference in commit messages.) --- ## Definition of Done (base phase) - `connections_panel` opens, status lights work (REST ping, MarketData WS, Order Events WS in **sandbox**). - Payload builder signs and **successfully** calls `/v1/balances` (sandbox), redacted request/response written to RAG. - SuperCryptoTracker feed emits real-time ticks; provider perf snapshots written under `var/perf/`. - Agent selector produces a shortlist; micro agent **dry-runs** decisions and logs would-place payloads to RAG. - Kill-switch cancels sandbox session orders and pauses agents. - No secrets in repo; `.gitignore` excludes `/var/**`. - UI uses high-contrast styles and notes the rule in comments. --- ### Optional dev ergonomics (nice to have) - Support `/ask` and `/code` in PR comments: - `/ask <question>` → RAG search + answer in PR comment. - `/code <stub-id>` → apply indicated task-stub patch and push to branch. — Short version for Codex: keep it sandbox, centralize signer/nonce/backoff, show the math, light the lights, write the receipts (RAG), and **never** leak secrets. Once those are green, we’ll let the agents actually click the button.
