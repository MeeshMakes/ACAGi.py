- `memory/` — Durable knowledge base (`codex_memory.json`) and actionable instruction queue (`logic_inbox.jsonl`).
- `logs/` — Daily session journals capturing objectives, context review, and follow-up prompts.
- `Dev_Logic/` — Workspace for active design documents, plus `Implemented_logic/` for ratified decisions.
- `Archived Conversation/` — Historical reference for superseded content and discussions.
- `.github/workflows/codex-pr-sentinel.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow running Codex PR Sentinel checks.
